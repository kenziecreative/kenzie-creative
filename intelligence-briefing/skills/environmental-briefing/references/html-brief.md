# HTML brief rendering

How to render the brief as a self-contained HTML file. This governs **presentation only** — what content goes in each item is decided by the OUTPUT CONTRACT in SKILL.md. Render with the `Write` tool; no shell, no scripts.

Read this file at the render step only when `format` is `html` (the default). If `format` is `markdown`, skip all of this and write the Markdown brief per the OUTPUT CONTRACT instead.

## Assemble the file

Produce one self-contained `.html` file at `<briefs dir>/YYYY-MM-DD.html`. If that file already exists, write `YYYY-MM-DD-02.html`, `-03`, and so on — never overwrite. Structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Daily Brief — <Month D, YYYY></title>
<!-- THEME_FONT_LINK -->
<style>
<!-- inline the FULL contents of ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/brief.css here, verbatim -->
<!-- THEME_TOKENS -->
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="wrap">
<!-- content blocks, in order: page head, collection health, Lead, Scan (by zone),
     Synthesis, Reckoning (only when due), Disconfirming, force proposal (only when
     the scan left one), footer -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS is fixed; you only generate the body content.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/brief.css` and paste it whole inside `<style>`. Do not rewrite or restyle it — design consistency depends on it being inlined unchanged.

**Theming (optional).** If `theme` in CLAUDE.md names a CSS file (e.g. `./brief-theme.css`), read it and inline its contents **after** brief.css inside the same `<style>` block, so its `:root` overrides the defaults. Convention for web fonts: if the theme file's **first line** is a comment of the form `/* font-link: <url> */`, emit `<link rel="stylesheet" href="<url>">` at the `<!-- THEME_FONT_LINK -->` marker and inline the rest of the file (everything after that first line) after brief.css. Do not inline an `@import` (it would sit after other rules and be ignored). If `theme` is empty or `default`, omit both the link and the override — the default uses system fonts and needs no network. Never hard-fail because a theme file is missing or unreadable; fall back to the default silently. The brief must read correctly even if the web fonts fail to load (the theme's fallbacks and palette carry it).

## Content blocks

Use these exact patterns. They map 1:1 onto the brief's content — same items, same order, same marks as the Markdown contract.

**Page head** — eyebrow, title, one-line standfirst, dated meta. The title may be a short editorial line; keep it plain if a quiet day.
```
<div class="app-page-head">
  <div>
    <div class="app-page-sub">Environmental Daily Briefing</div>
    <h1 class="app-page-title">The Morning Scan</h1>
    <p class="app-page-desc">One-sentence standfirst: the shape of the day.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page-meta">No. MM·DD·YY<br>Weekday</div>
</div>
```

**Collection health** — **MANDATORY, immediately after the page head, on every brief.** Three variants. Exactly one always renders. There is no fourth state and no way to omit it. (If the scan did not run at all, use the degraded variant's markup with a plain statement of when collection last succeeded.)

```
<!-- run complete, items found -->
<div class="collect">
  <span class="state">Collection current</span>
  <span class="detail">6 of 6 cells due today completed. Rotation 78% complete this week.</span>
</div>

<!-- run complete, nothing found -->
<div class="collect is-quiet">
  <span class="state">Quiet day</span>
  <span class="detail">All cells due today were scanned; none are overdue. Nothing moved.</span>
</div>

<!-- run degraded -->
<div class="collect is-degraded">
  <span class="state">Assessment degraded</span>
  <span class="detail">Policy Levers × AI-advice regulation and SciTech Frontier × model capability did not complete. This brief covers 4 of 6 due cells. <strong>No driver moved today, because collection is incomplete.</strong></span>
</div>
```

**Section head** (Lead / Scan / Synthesis / The Reckoning / Disconfirming):
```
<div class="section-head"><span class="label">Lead</span><span class="line"></span><span class="count">3 items</span></div>
```

**Lead item** — add class `is-lead` to the card. Tags: `Fact`/`Signal`/`Frame` as plain `tag-pill`; disposition as `is-act`/`is-track` (omit a chip for plain `note`); a non-default tier as `is-src`.
```
<article class="card is-lead"><div class="card-body">
  <div class="tag-row"><span class="tag-pill">Fact</span><span class="tag-pill is-act">Act</span></div>
  <h3 class="card-title">Headline in your words</h3>
  <p class="card-desc">What happened, qualifiers intact.</p>
  <div class="relevance"><span class="panel-label">Why it lands</span>Why this clears the bar.</div>
  <div class="src"><span class="cite">Publisher · YYYY-MM-DD · source type</span><a href="URL">domain.com →</a></div>
</div></article>
```

**Signpost fired** — a lead-weight card carrying the accent border and the flag. **This is the item the reader gets even if they read nothing in between**, so it sorts above everything else in the Lead.
```
<article class="card is-lead is-signpost"><div class="card-body">
  <span class="signpost-flag">Signpost fired</span>
  <div class="tag-row"><span class="tag-pill">Fact</span><span class="tag-pill is-act">Act</span></div>
  <h3 class="card-title">The EU's AI content-labeling Code of Practice published</h3>
  <p class="card-desc">What happened, qualifiers intact.</p>
  <div class="driver">
    <span class="panel-label">What you were watching for</span>
    On 2026-06-07 you were told to watch for publication of the finalized Code of Practice, expected by end of June. <span class="move">It published 2026-06-26.</span> This moves <em>Regulatory obligations on AI advice are hardening</em> from Medium to <span class="move">High</span>.
  </div>
  <div class="src"><span class="cite">Publisher · YYYY-MM-DD · primary</span><a href="URL">domain.com →</a></div>
</div></article>
```

An **expired** signpost (the predicted event did not happen) renders the same way, with the flag reading `Signpost expired` and the driver block stating that the absence is evidence in the opposite direction. **A prediction that failed to happen is a result, not a non-event.**

**Driver movement on an ordinary item** — the `.driver` block sits between `.relevance` and `.src`, in the same position `.watch` occupies for a Signal. **It is a clause on an item. It is never a standalone card and never a status board.**
```
<article class="card"><div class="card-body">
  <div class="tag-row"><span class="tag-pill">Fact</span><span class="tag-pill is-track">Track</span></div>
  <h3 class="card-title">Google adds an advisory agent to Workspace for small business</h3>
  <p class="card-desc">What happened, qualifiers intact.</p>
  <div class="relevance"><span class="panel-label">Why it lands</span>Why this clears the bar.</div>
  <div class="driver">
    <span class="panel-label">Where this sits</span>
    <span class="move">The fourth move in six weeks</span> on <em>AI advisory commoditization at the SMB front door</em>, which goes Medium → <span class="move">High</span>. Your June 7 read — that the defensible edge sits in proprietary data and program integration — still holds; nothing since has cut against it.
  </div>
  <div class="src"><span class="cite">Publisher · YYYY-MM-DD · secondary</span><a href="URL">domain.com →</a></div>
</div></article>
```

**Zone head** then its items. A scan item is the same card without `is-lead`. Signals add a watch block:
```
<div class="zone-head"><span class="label">Emerging Impact</span><span class="line"></span></div>
<article class="card"><div class="card-body">
  <div class="tag-row"><span class="tag-pill is-signal">Signal</span><span class="tag-pill is-src">tertiary</span></div>
  <h3 class="card-title">Headline</h3>
  <p class="card-desc">What happened.</p>
  <div class="relevance"><span class="panel-label">Why it lands</span>...</div>
  <div class="watch"><span class="panel-label">Watch for</span>What would confirm or falsify.</div>
  <div class="src"><span class="cite">Publisher · date · type</span><a href="URL">domain.com →</a></div>
</div></article>
```

**Zone overflow** — renders **only** when material items exceed the zone detail budget. Every dropped-to-a-line item still appears. **Compression, never deletion.**
```
<div class="also">
  <span class="panel-label">Also in this zone</span>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="URL">Second state adopts an incompatible audit standard</a> — Fact · Track</li>
    <li><a href="URL">Trade body publishes model compliance guidance</a> — Frame · Note</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Promoted stub** (a lead item's pointer in its home zone):
```
<div class="promoted"><span class="arrow">↑</span>Short title — promoted to Lead.</div>
```

**Synthesis** (omit the block if none; show the section head with "No cross-zone pattern today."):
```
<div class="synthesis">
  <span class="panel-label">The pattern across today</span>
  <h3 class="synthesis-title">The pattern, named.</h3>
  <p>The thread, drawing only on items in the scan.</p>
  <p class="draws">Draws on: item · item · item</p>
</div>
```

**The reckoning** — renders as its own section, after Synthesis, on the first `complete` run 30+ days since the last one. **A section of the brief, not a fourth artifact.**
```
<div class="section-head"><span class="label">The Reckoning</span><span class="line"></span><span class="count">last 30 days</span></div>

<div class="reckoning">
  <h3 class="reckoning-title">Your picture moved twice, and one thing you believed broke.</h3>

  <div class="reck-block">
    <span class="panel-label">What moved</span>
    <p><span class="moved">Commoditization at the SMB front door · Uncertain/Medium → Increasing/High</span><br>
    Moved 2026-06-07 (Meta goes global), 2026-06-19 (pricing tiers land), 2026-07-14 (Google enters). Seven observations behind it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reck-block">
    <span class="panel-label">What held</span>
    <p>Your June 7 read — that the defensible edge migrates to proprietary data and program integration — survived the period. It is now the load-bearing assumption in your product strategy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reck-block is-wrong">
    <span class="panel-label">What you were wrong about</span>
    <p>On June 7 you treated the US light-touch executive order as lowering compliance drag. Three observations since suggest state-level action is filling the federal gap. That force is stronger than you logged it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reck-block">
    <span class="panel-label">Signposts</span>
    <p>One fired: the EU Code of Practice published June 26. One expired unfired: no second jurisdiction converged on a common audit standard, which is itself evidence for fragmentation.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Write the reckoning in the same editorial register as the rest of the brief. **It is a reckoning, not a report card.** Do not score the reader and do not congratulate them.

**Disconfirming** — reports what the falsifier search found, naming the driver each item challenges (such items render as ordinary cards with a `.driver` clause). When it found nothing, that is itself information:
```
<div class="disconf">Nothing surfaced against your four active drivers this week.</div>
```

**Emergent driver proposal** — renders at the foot of the brief when the scan proposed a new force. **The brief proposes; it never creates.** Confirmation happens in the review conversation.
```
<div class="propose">
  <span class="panel-label">A force may be forming</span>
  Five observations across six weeks now point at something I don't have a driver for: state-level AI rules filling the federal gap. Tell me to track it, or tell me it's noise.
</div>
```

**Footer**:
```
<footer><span>Environmental Daily Briefing · zone taxonomy v1</span><span>Act · Track · Note · Watch</span></footer>
```

## Rules

- The HTML carries exactly the content the OUTPUT CONTRACT defines — nothing added, nothing dropped. The card chrome is presentation; the words are the brief.
- **The collection-health block renders on every brief.** There is no path — rich, quiet, degraded, or no-scan — that omits it.
- Escape `&`, `<`, `>` in any text you place into HTML.
- A quiet day still renders cleanly: empty zones can be omitted or shown with a one-line "No qualifying items in window." note; an empty Lead shows "Quiet day — nothing meets the lead bar."
- Keep it one file. Do not link external CSS/JS. The only allowed network reference is a theme's web-font `<link>`, and the page must still read correctly if it fails to load.
- No JavaScript, no content-hiding entrance animations, flat design: no colored edge bars and no drop shadows. These are hard rules, not aesthetic preferences.
