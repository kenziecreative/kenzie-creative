# goal-setting-pulse — The High-Frequency Cadences

This skill drives the two highest-frequency Ongoing cadences: the **daily** writing ritual and
the **weekly** pulse check. The invoking command names the cadence (`daily` from
`/goal-setting:daily`, `weekly` from `/goal-setting:pulse`). These are the most important
cadences and the easiest to skip — so they have to be the easiest to do. **Be terse.** Do not
turn either into a coaching session.

## Current State

!`cat goals/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No goals/STATE.md — run /goal-setting:init first."`

## Step 0: Preconditions

1. If `goals/STATE.md` does not exist, tell the user to run `/goal-setting:init` and stop.
2. Apply the return protocol in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/heartbeat.md` — trust order,
   stance restoration (the Working Dynamic calibrates even a five-minute pulse), overdue
   routing. Silently; a fired mitigation or an open closeout outranks the routine entry.
3. If `mode` is still `setup` (Setup Arc not complete), say so gently: "The daily/weekly
   cadences begin once Setup is done — you're on the Setup Arc. Finish it with
   `/goal-setting:<current_stage>`, or run the cadence anyway if you want to start the habit
   early." Respect their choice.
4. Read the active Objective(s) (and the current week's System) from `goals/active.md` so you
   can show them what to write / check against.

## Daily mode

The highest-frequency touchpoint. Writing the goal by hand, slowly enough to mean it, is a
daily act of attention and recommitment — and *varying the location* keeps the goal from
fading into the furniture the way a note stuck on the fridge does. Takes 60–90 seconds.

1. **Ask where they are today** — one line: "Where are you writing today? (Different
   room/spot than yesterday — that's the point.)" Read the last daily entry's location from
   `goals/journal.md` and nudge if it matches.
2. **Prompt the hand-writing.** Show the active Objective(s) — and optionally the quarter's
   most important KR or this week's System — and ask them to **write it by hand** and confirm
   done. The act of writing is the intervention; you are not writing it for them.
3. **Append the entry** to `goals/journal.md` under a daily section (newest at top):
   `- **[YYYY-MM-DD] daily** — location: <where>. Wrote: <objective(s) / what they wrote>.`
4. Update `Daily last run` in `goals/STATE.md`. Close in one line. Done.

Keep it under two minutes of interaction. No formatting demands, no journaling prompts.

## Weekly mode (Mondays)

Five minutes, one question **per goal** — up to three, so still five minutes. This is
intelligent adaptation, not a guilt ritual — you're asking "is the design working?", not
"did I work hard enough?"

1. **Ask per active Objective** (one at a time, one line each):

   > *"[Objective A] — did its system run last week? Is the KR moving?"*

   Capture per Objective: `system_executed` (yes / no / **unknown**) and `kr_progressing`
   (yes / no / **unknown**, or n/a when the system didn't run). **A half-answer is not yes,
   no, or permission to infer.** If the user answers for one goal and trails off, or says
   "mostly," record `unknown` for what wasn't answered and move on — never fill it in from
   tone. An aggregate "yes, all of them ran" is a real answer for all three; "things went
   fine" is not. When reality diverges *within* one goal — one KR up while another falls,
   one of its systems ran and another didn't — record `mixed` with a one-line note naming
   the split ("leads up, close rate down"). Mixed is a real answer; never average it to
   yes or no. If anything is no, unknown, or mixed, capture the free-text "what needs to
   change."

2. **Sweep the weekly mitigation triggers** (one line, only if any exist): for each
   mitigation in `goals/active.md` with `check_frequency: weekly` — "any of these trip last
   week: <conditions>?" Three honest outcomes per signal: **fired** (set `triggered_active`,
   surface its `then Y` action now), **clear** (the user actually read the signal — update
   `last_checked`), or **unchecked** (they couldn't or didn't look — record `unchecked`
   with the date, no guilt, and never write it down as clear). Note the sweep in the
   journal entry. Don't expand this into a review.

3. **Surface the classification** per goal that needs it (one or two lines total, not per
   goal):
   - **Executed + not progressing** → the *goal* (or the KR measuring it) may be the misfit.
     The system is running and the KR isn't moving; that points at the goal, not the effort.
     Flag it for the monthly review.
   - **Didn't execute** → the *system* may be wrong. The design isn't holding; revise the
     system (the Four Laws), don't blame willpower.
   - **Unknown** → say what's unknown and leave it unknown: "No read on [KR] this week —
     worth an actual look before the monthly."
   - **Mixed** → don't flatten it; the one-line split is the record, and the monthly review
     untangles it.
   - **Executed + progressing** → working. Say so plainly and stop.

4. **Append the entry** to `goals/journal.md` under a weekly section (newest at top), one
   line per Objective:

   ```
   - **[YYYY-MM-DD] weekly**
     - <Objective A>: executed: yes; progressing: mixed — leads up, close rate down
     - <Objective B>: executed: unknown; progressing: unknown
     - mitigations: <id> clear | <id> unchecked (since <date>) | <condition> FIRED → <action taken/queued>
     - change: <text or "none">
   ```

5. **If `mode: restart`, evaluate the hold** (this replaces nothing — it's additional):
   the pulse is what moves the restart machine. See "Restart hold" below.

6. Update `Weekly pulse last run` in `goals/STATE.md`. Five minutes max.

### Restart hold (weekly mode while `mode: restart`)

The Restart Protocol has an entrance *and an exit*, and the weekly pulse is the exit's
evaluator. The criterion: **two consecutive weekly pulses with the system under evaluation
executed** (`yes` — an `unknown` doesn't count as clean). The evaluation state is the typed
Active Flags in STATE (`restart_system`, `restart_clean_weeks`,
`restart_last_clean_pulse`, `restart_queue`) — **every weekly pulse in restart mode updates
them**, clean or not, so a context-lost next session reads week-one-vs-week-two from the
file instead of guessing: clean → increment `restart_clean_weeks`, set
`restart_last_clean_pulse`; unclean or unknown → reset `restart_clean_weeks: 0`. (If the
flags are missing — a deployment restarted under an older version — reconstruct them once
from the journal's restart and weekly entries, write them, and continue.)

- **`restart_phase: stabilizing`** — one system is live (`restart_system`). After the
  *first* clean week (`restart_clean_weeks` hits 1), ask the one diagnostic question the
  restart deliberately skipped: "One clean week in — anything about what knocked you off
  worth capturing now?" (One line; record durable causes in Coaching Memory.) When
  `restart_clean_weeks` hits 2: the hold is met. If `restart_queue` is non-empty, set
  `restart_phase: reintroducing`, reactivate the FIRST queued system (`status: active` in
  `goals/active.md` — the user may reorder the queue first), point `restart_system` at it,
  and reset `restart_clean_weeks: 0`. If the queue is empty, set `mode: ongoing`,
  `restart_phase: none`, clear the restart flags, and say plainly that the practice is back.
- **`restart_phase: reintroducing`** — same evaluation for `restart_system`. Each
  reactivation needs its own two clean weeks. When the queue is empty and the current
  system has held two weeks, set `mode: ongoing`, `restart_phase: none`, clear the flags.
  (A user may retire a queued system instead of reactivating it — a recorded keep/retire
  call in `goals/active.md`; remove it from the queue.)
- A missed or unclean week resets that system's count to 0; it does not restart the whole
  protocol or earn a lecture. Note it and keep going.

Record every transition in the journal restart line and in STATE (`restart_phase`, the
restart flags, `Next due`).

## Guardrails

1. **Terseness is the feature.** These cadences fail when they get heavy. Daily is ~90 seconds;
   weekly is 5 minutes. Don't expand them.
2. The daily ritual is the user writing *by hand* — your job is to prompt and log, not to
   compose the entry for them.
3. Append to `goals/journal.md`; never overwrite prior entries. Newest at top.
4. The weekly classification is a pointer for the monthly review, not a verdict. Surface it and
   move on; don't relitigate the goal in five minutes.
5. **Unknown stays unknown.** A half-answer is recorded as `unknown`, never inferred to yes or
   no — and never used to guilt the user.
6. Update the matching `last run` line in STATE.md so `/goal-setting:progress` stays accurate.
7. During restart, the pulse is the exit evaluator — run the hold check every weekly pulse
   until `mode: ongoing` is restored. A stalled restart is the skill's failure, not the
   user's.
