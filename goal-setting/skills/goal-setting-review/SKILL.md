# goal-setting-review — The Periodic Reviews

This skill drives the three periodic Ongoing cadences: the **monthly** KR review, the
**quarterly** review (the deepest below the annual check), and the **annual** vision check. The
invoking command names the cadence (`monthly`, `quarterly`, `annual`). Where these reviews
replan goals, the **same hard constraints as setup apply** — carry the chief-of-staff posture
from the Setup Arc: push on soft answers, stay in the user's lane, enforce the three-goal rule.

## Current State

!`cat goals/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No goals/STATE.md — run /goal-setting:init first."`

## Step 0: Preconditions

1. If `goals/STATE.md` does not exist, tell the user to run `/goal-setting:init` and stop.
2. Apply the return protocol in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/heartbeat.md` — trust order,
   stance restoration (adopt the Working Dynamic before the first substantive line), overdue
   routing. Silently.
3. If `mode` is still `setup`, tell the user the reviews operate against a completed Setup Arc
   and point them to finish it. Respect their choice to proceed anyway.
4. Read `goals/active.md`, `goals/scorecard.md`, recent `goals/journal.md` entries, and
   `goals/history.md` (past dispositions inform this quarter's read) so the review works
   against real state, not from scratch.

## Monthly mode (~1 hour)

The diagnostic the five-minute pulse can't make: *are we on track, and if not, is the goal
wrong or the execution wrong?* The pulse catches problems; the monthly review classifies them.

For **each active Objective:**

1. Assess **on track / off track** against its KRs (current vs. target).
2. Classify why:
   - **Execution is wrong** — the system isn't being run consistently or isn't well designed.
     Fix: revise the system using the Four Laws. *Don't change the goal.*
   - **Goal is wrong** — the system is running consistently and the KR still isn't moving. Fix:
     revise the KR (or the Objective, if the misfit is deeper). *Don't blame execution.*

   Most owners default to blaming execution when the goal is actually wrong. Push against that
   default — if the user reports they executed and it's not moving, name that it points at the
   goal. Where the week-by-week record shows `unknown`s, treat the diagnosis as thinner than
   it looks and say so — a month of unknowns is not a month of yeses.
3. **Check the countermetric** (if the Objective's goal contract names one): did the thing
   that must not deteriorate hold? A KR on track at the countermetric's expense is a finding,
   not a win.
4. **Sweep every mitigation trigger** in `goals/active.md` (weekly-frequency ones get checked
   at the pulse; monthly gets all of them): for each, has the trigger condition occurred? If
   fired, set `triggered_active`, surface the committed `then Y` action, and agree what
   happens now. If a triggered mitigation was acted on, record the response evidence and set
   `resolved`.
5. Record the specific change being made (if any) for next month.

**If a change revises a KR or an Objective, the original commitment is preserved — never
overwritten.** Append a revision record under that goal in `goals/active.md` before making
the change:

```
- revised [YYYY-MM-DD]: <field> was <original target> (actual at change: <current value>) →
  now <new target>. Reason: <the user's why>. Classification: <goal_wrong | execution_wrong>.
```

The revised goal keeps its full record; a goal that gets easier quietly is exactly what this
line exists to prevent. If the revision is deep enough that it's really a *different*
commitment (new Objective in the same anchor), that's a closeout + replacement: the old
Objective gets a disposition in `goals/history.md` (status `superseded`), and the new one
starts clean.

Write the per-Objective assessment to `goals/journal.md` under a monthly section. Update
`Monthly review last run`.

## Quarterly mode (half day to full day)

Five things in sequence. This is where replanning happens, so the three-goal rule is back in
force — and **nothing gets planned until the outgoing quarter is closed.**

1. **Close out the outgoing quarter (THE GATE — replanning does not open until this is
   done).** For each Objective whose period is ending, force a disposition:
   - **achieved** — the KRs got there. Record final actuals.
   - **missed** — worked honestly, didn't get there. Record final actuals vs. targets.
   - **abandoned** — deliberately dropped mid-quarter or now. Record why.
   - **superseded** — replaced by a successor Objective (carrying forward is a *new*
     commitment next quarter, linked to this record — not the same goal silently rolling).

   For each: capture **lessons** (one to three lines — what the quarter taught about the
   goal, the system, or the estimate), set the Objective's `status` accordingly, and move
   its full record — original commitment, every revision record, final actuals, disposition,
   lessons — from `goals/active.md` to `goals/history.md`. This is what makes room under the
   three-goal cap without inventing an archival step under pressure; a quarter that ends
   with three actives and no dispositions is the forbidden-fourth trap. The disposition
   calls are the user's; requiring *a* disposition is yours.
2. **Re-run the Anchor Areas Scorecard.** Fresh diagnostic, not a reaffirmation — has anything
   moved? Did the focused area improve? New vulnerabilities? Score all seven honestly (use the
   chapters in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/anchor-areas/` and the signals of strength as
   the check). Append a dated snapshot row to the Score History in `goals/scorecard.md`.
3. **Audit each system: keep / revise / retire.** For each active system ask: is this still
   moving the KRs, or has it decayed into ceremony (doing the meeting, not gaining the
   insight)? Update `goals/active.md` accordingly.
4. **Plan next quarter's Objectives + KRs.** Review the Candidate Backlog in `goals/STATE.md`
   first — deferred candidates compete for the open slots on equal footing, and each gets its
   decision recorded (swapped in / deferred again / rejected). Set the new Objectives and KRs
   for the next 90 days. **Enforce the same hard constraints as Stage 4** (see
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/stages/04-goals.md`): max three active Objectives, one per
   active anchor area, every Objective tagged to an active anchor, KRs measurable with baseline
   and target, each with its goal contract. Refuse a fourth Objective or an orphaned one. Each
   Objective must still pass the Stage 1 three tests.
5. **Run the recurring pre-mortem.** Different from the launch version — the user now has real
   data. Pull the protocol from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/stages/06-premortem.md` and ask:
   which original mitigation triggers fired, and did they work? What unexpected risks surfaced?
   What's most likely to kill the *next* quarter, given what's now known? Produce a revised
   mitigation list (each with `if X` + `then Y` plus its monitored signal and check frequency,
   tagged `source: recurring_premortem`). Refuse incomplete mitigations. Update
   `goals/active.md`.

Write the full quarterly entry to `goals/journal.md` (dispositions with lessons, updated
scorecard snapshot, system keep/revise/retire decisions, backlog decisions, next-quarter
Objectives, revised mitigations). Update the `Quarterly review last run` and the Current
Period (advance the quarter) in `goals/STATE.md`.

---

## Annual mode (~1 day)

Where the Ongoing Arc loops back into the Setup Arc. Reopen the Stage 1 questions:

- *What game am I playing? Is this still the right game?*
- *What do I actually want? Is the Horizon 3 vision still true?*
- *Does last year's Direction still survive the three tests?*

Most years the answer is *yes, with refinements* — confirm the vision and note it.

If the vision changed: capture the new Horizon 3 vision in `goals/vision.md`, then **hand off
explicitly** — every downstream stage cascades from a revised Horizon 3:

> Your vision changed. Re-run `/goal-setting:horizons` and the downstream Setup stages — the
> new Horizon 3 reshapes your horizons, anchors, and goals.

Set `current_stage: horizons` and `mode: setup` in STATE.md if the vision changed; otherwise
keep `mode: ongoing`. Write the annual entry to `goals/journal.md` and update `Annual vision
check last run`.

Without this check, a user can spend a decade executing brilliantly against a goal they
outgrew years ago. That's the failure the annual check exists to prevent.

## Guardrails

1. **Replanning re-invokes the three-goal rule.** Quarterly Objective-setting enforces max
   three / one-per-anchor / no-orphans as refusals, exactly like Stage 4.
   And **closeout precedes replanning** — no new Objective activates while an outgoing one
   has no disposition.
2. **Originals are never overwritten.** Every KR/Objective revision appends a revision record
   preserving the original target and the actual at the time of change; closed goals keep
   their full record in `goals/history.md`. A commitment can end honestly; it cannot
   disappear.
3. Carry the chief-of-staff posture: push on soft assessments ("it's fine" without evidence),
   but the calls that are the user's — which anchor, what target, whether to keep a system,
   which disposition a closing goal gets — stay theirs.
4. The monthly classification (goal-wrong vs. execution-wrong) is the load-bearing move; don't
   let the user default to blaming execution when the data points at the goal.
5. Append to `goals/journal.md`; update the matching `last run` line and Current Period in
   STATE.md so `/goal-setting:progress` stays accurate.
6. The recurring pre-mortem is sharper than the launch one because it has real data — make it
   specific to what actually broke this quarter, not theoretical.
