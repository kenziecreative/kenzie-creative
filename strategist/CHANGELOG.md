# Changelog — strategist

All notable changes to the Strategist plugin. Per-plugin semver; tags are plugin-scoped
(`strategist-vX.Y.Z`).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-12

The **pass-2 hardening release** — same-day repairs for the six PARTIAL verdicts from
the disclosed Codex re-attack on 0.4.0 (triage record:
`dev/blind-reviews/strategist-pass2-2026-07.md`, owner's machine). The through-line
fix: the state model stops conflating *"the user chose to proceed"* with *"the work
satisfies its contract."* Advisory design untouched — nothing blocks; everything
records, honestly.

- **Two-axis claim marking (F1).** Ownership is origin (user / agent / external) ×
  standing (first-hand / unverified / estimate). User-relayed ≠ user-owned: a
  benchmark the user quotes is external + unverified, whatever mouth it arrived
  through; ambiguity degrades, never flatters. Both axes survive into "What this
  rests on."
- **The commitment gate stops keeping secrets (F2).** The critic now receives the full
  alternative set, the evaluation basis, and why each option provisionally lost — a
  rigged field is now its to name, not just the winning argument. `Pressure-tested`
  vocabulary becomes `clear / open (n) / declined`; tested-with-a-standing-objection
  is not clear, and every unresolved load-bearing finding travels — substance and
  disposition — into DECISION.md and the reader brief (the one deliberate exception
  to the no-process-residue rule: a standing objection is a limitation the reader is
  owed). The Synthesise README's stale "offered" wiring corrected to the auto-run.
- **The Insight boundary goes blanket (F3).** Every Insight form is current-state-only
  at Insight, entry section or not; From:To, Horizon, and Chevron join the five 0.4.0
  entries with their own Stage Boundary sections (the To column, forward horizons,
  and phased routes are decisions, not observations).
- **Staleness is canonical (F4).** Stale stages leave `completed_stages` for a new
  `stale_stages` frontmatter list; Position recomputes after invalidation, never
  before; a stale marker clears top-down only — reconciling downstream while upstream
  is still stale earns `complete (on stale inputs)`, not `complete`.
- **Advance-past-a-done-bar reads what it is (F5).** Status
  `incomplete (advanced by user)`, excluded from `completed_stages`; progress gains
  the Notes column plus an unmet-done-bars line, and resume briefs it.
- **Mid-stage work survives an unsaved stop (F6).** The engine refreshes In-Flight in
  STATE.md after each substantive answer, so auto-compaction with no `/strategist:save`
  no longer loses the half-finished stage; save remains the curated debrief.
- **Instruments.** Drift lint gains six retired phrases and three new reader/writer
  vocabulary contracts (it caught one regression during this very build); the eval
  harness's `section_filled` gate is n/a on expected-no-advance runs (mid-stage ledger
  writes are legitimate work product — iteration-1 proof case). Golden set re-run
  green post-repair. Still pending Kelsey's review, unchanged: the rubric
  Continuity/Register package and the golden-scenario end-state pin.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-12

The **convergence release** — the strategist half of the backstage convergence plan
(all six HIGH items, all MED items, and five of seven LOW items from the 2026-07-11
re-audit). Every pattern ported from Brand Compass enters as **SHIPPED-UNTESTED**
(the return: save/resume/Working Read/Backstage Tasks; the charter; the decision
record; the option set; the provenance valve; the plan ledger); nothing graduates
from a build session.

- **Record, never restrict (invariant 11 — the HIGH cluster).** Nothing new blocks;
  every consequential user call now leaves a trace. Claim ownership (user-owned /
  agent-inferred / external-unverified) is marked in the working record and survives
  into the reader brief — in prose plus a closing **"What this rests on"** section; no
  citations, no research gate (the no-evidence-layer lock stands, decision E1). A
  **declined pressure-test** is marked in STATE and said plainly in the reader brief. A
  material upstream revision marks later completed stages **`stale (premise changed)`**;
  progress surfaces it; running on a stale premise warns once and records the choice.
  Advancing past an unmet done-bar is the user's call — noted in the record.
- **The commitment gate earns the marketing copy (decisions C2 + E2).** At Synthesise,
  before the commitment write: the through-line stands against **real alternatives**
  (status quo / reversible test / preferred / materially different / ambitious, with the
  honest-singleton valve); the **critic auto-runs** — non-blocking, decline recorded —
  which is what makes "pressure-tests your reasoning before you commit" true as
  written; the commitment is checked against the charter; a **Rumelt-kernel check**
  records diagnosis / guiding policy / coherent actions / advantage mechanism /
  exclusions as present-thin-absent (records, never blocks, decision E3); and a
  standing **decision record** (`strategy/DECISION.md`) is written. The existing
  descriptions are unchanged — items 2 + E2 earn them.
- **Done-bars are the completion contract.** The engine reads each stage README's "the
  stage is done when" block as its checklist before advancing. `progress` stops calling
  an unresolved finding a "blocker" — no gate exists, and the vocabulary now says so.
- **The return restores stance.** New `/strategist:save` (session debrief & state save,
  works mid-stage) and `/strategist:resume` (re-adopts Working Dynamic + **Working
  Read**, continues **In-Flight** mid-stage work without re-asking, executes
  **Backstage Tasks** silently, additive-only schema migration, spoken briefing).
  STATE gains Working Read / In-Flight / Backstage Tasks and a Stage Record Notes
  column. Anti-contamination rule in the engine, progress, and resume: **files win
  over chat memory and compaction summaries, silently.**
- **Insight framework boundary (blind F3).** The five generative Insight entries (3x3,
  Continuum, Capability Map, Gantt, One Pager) carry **Stage Boundary** rules —
  current-state form at Insight; dispositions, targets, and forward plans belong at
  Synthesise/Story/Move. Contradicting entry sentences fixed; the engine honors entry
  boundaries. `strategy-spine.md` (canon copy) untouched.
- **Engagement charter, wired (decision E3).** `/strategist:init` captures
  `strategy/CHARTER.md` in one compact prompt (partial answers accepted): the decision,
  decider, reader, stakes, deadline + required confidence, constraints + non-goals,
  evidence + gaps. It's read — stage preconditions, the commitment gate, the Story
  reader line — not filed (checklist row 12).
- **Self-Audit friction check gains the provenance valve.** Naming the least-examined
  load-bearing answer stays mandatory; manufacturing its defect is forbidden; "named,
  graded sound" is a legitimate recorded outcome; challenges ground in the user's own
  material.
- **Analyse runs on a plan ledger** — per Frame dimension: question, evidence required,
  disconfirming test, status, what-if-unobtainable. A skipped-because-obvious dimension
  stops being possible silently. And the framework menu stays mandatory while **"no
  framework — first-principles"** becomes an honest recorded outcome.
- **Measurement + tooling.** New release-blocking doctrine-drift/canon-sync lint
  (`dev/scripts/lint-doctrine-drift.mjs`, plugin-configurable; strategist config wires
  the four canon pairs, retired phrases, referenced sections, and reader/writer
  vocabulary contracts). Shared tooling: researcher and goal-setting add their own
  configs.
- **Pending Kelsey review (STOP items, drafted to the review queue, not shipped):** the
  eval rubric's new Continuity and Register dimensions (0–3 anchors), the
  `adv-mid-stage-resume` golden scenario, and the adapter note they require.
- **Deferred:** eval-suite expansion from the ten Codex seeds (interlocks with the
  pending rubric package — landing them together keeps coverage coherent); multi-
  stakeholder modes, owner-acceptance, and the data-workbench remain deferred by
  decision G1.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-27

The **Strategy Spine** — Define → Frame → Analyse → Insight → Synthesise → Story → Move
(looping back to Define) — anchored to the author's own Metaskills and Learning-and-Teaching
frameworks, shipped into `reference/frameworks/` as copies of the canonical source docs.

- **Stage changes.** **Split → Frame** and **Act → Move** (renames). A new **Synthesise**
  stage is added between Insight and Story — build the insights into a coherent whole,
  reconcile tensions, prioritize, set the through-line. The standalone **Decide** stage is
  **folded into Synthesise plus a commitment gate** before Story; commitment to the chosen
  strategy locks there.
- **Frameworks anchored to canon.** The Strategy Spine and its sibling frameworks are
  shipped in `reference/frameworks/` as copies of the canonical docs at
  `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/AI Operations/frameworks/`; that canon is the source of truth,
  and the shipped copies are verified against it on each update.
- **All framework diagram images removed.** The phase reference docs are rewritten to
  explain each phase and teach tool selection — which framework the moment calls for and why
  — rather than just list frameworks behind a diagram.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-27

Critic restraint fix, caught by the internal strategist eval (golden `adv-sound-strategy`).
The pressure-test critic was over-applying v0.2.0's fabricated/unowned-premise check: on a
sound brief it labeled the user's own $80k budget a "FABRICATED PREMISE" and padded the
review with a generic 5-Whys critique and a "return to growth" gap — manufacturing serious
flaws where the reasoning actually held, which trains the user to ignore the critic.

- **`agents/strategist-critic.md`:** scoped the fabricated/unowned-premise check (#7) to fire
  only on a claim the *agent inferred* that the strategy's logic *depends on* — explicitly
  **not** on a decision the user owns (budget, timeline, target, scope). A number the user
  chose is not a premise to prove.
- Added a **"What Is Not A Finding"** section: user-owned decisions, generic method critiques
  not grounded in this brief, the standard reading of the problem, and non-load-bearing
  details are not flaws. Affirm sound reasoning and stop.

Verified by re-eval: `adv-sound-strategy` now passes 3/3 samples (critic affirms, no
manufactured premise); `adv-planted-contradiction` still catches the real cross-stage
contradiction (no loss of edge).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-19

Posture and deliverable refinement, driven by the first full real-world run (Hello Alice
Partner-Powered Agents). Additive and backward-compatible — existing projects keep working;
the reader brief is created the next time they run Story.

- **Posture rewritten as enumerable rules** in the stage engine (`strategist-stage`). The
  old "Facilitator, not Service Desk" tone guidance becomes behavioral rules in two halves:
  a *friction half* (push on the logic) and a *lane half* — conviction-source rule (assert
  only on the strategy's mechanism or what the user stated, never on your own inference),
  lane discipline (timing/feasibility/cost are the user's; don't gate the strategy on them),
  provisional framing (your own frames are proposals, dropped on redirect), and stall-don't-
  fabricate-don't-over-stall. Borrowed from Hello Alice's advisor "posture vs judgment" work.
- **Two-part Self-Audit** replaces the single Pushback Audit: a friction check plus a lane &
  fabrication check, run before each stage closes.
- **Two documents.** The loop now maintains a working record (`brief.md`) *and* a clean
  reader-facing brief (`strategy/strategy-brief.md`, configurable as `reader_brief`),
  generated at Story and refreshed through Decide/Act. Reader-Brief Style Rules strip
  process narration, framework labels, source links, and reconciliation notes, and enforce
  a falsifiability bar on every claim.
- **One isolated question per turn** — the ask is stated plainly on its own, not buried in
  analysis. Working Dynamic calibration now updates after the first substantive exchange.
- **Two new critic checks:** *fabricated/unowned premise* (a feasibility/timing/cost claim
  the assistant inferred rather than the user establishing) and *agent-introduced keystone*
  (a framing the assistant added quietly becoming the spine).
- Docs (README, AGENTS, template config) and `/strategist:progress` updated for the
  two-document model.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-13

Initial release.

- The seven-stage strategy loop — Define → Split → Analyse → Insight → Story → Decide →
  Act — as 11 commands over 5 skills, with resumable `strategy/STATE.md` state and a
  single living `strategy/brief.md` artefact.
- A library of **70 frameworks** across the seven stages, one markdown entry each with an
  embedded diagram, per-stage indexes, and a master `INDEX.md`. Each entry written to
  teach a newcomer (What It Is, Why It Works, How To Use It, Worked Example, When To Use
  It, Things To Watch Out For).
- `/strategist:framework <name>` — apply or explain any single framework, in or out of a
  project.
- `/strategist:pressure-test` + the `strategist-critic` subagent — stress-tests reasoning
  (assumptions, logical gaps, weak inferences, alternative framings, failure modes,
  cross-stage contradictions). Tests logic, not evidence.
- Live facilitation posture in the stage engine — a per-stage Pushback Audit (one genuine
  challenge minimum, higher at Analyse/Decide/Act), non-answer rejection, preference-vs-
  evidence redirect, reflect-back-and-confirm before capture, and per-user calibration via
  a `## Working Dynamic` block in STATE.md, with the pushback contract stated up front in
  `init`. The critic stays the deeper cross-stage pass; judgment also lives in the moment.
- `/strategist:progress` — read-only loop dashboard with infrastructure health checks.
- One PreCompact staleness hook (warns if `STATE.md` lags `brief.md`). No outputs gate —
  Strategist makes no source-rigor claim.
- Cowork-safe setup (Write-only, no shell); works on Claude Code and Cowork.
