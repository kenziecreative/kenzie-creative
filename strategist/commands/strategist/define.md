Run the **Define** stage of the strategy loop.

Use the `strategist-stage` skill for the **define** stage and follow its steps exactly.
It presents this stage's framework menu from the library
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/define/`), helps the user pick the framework that fits
their situation, applies it with them, writes the result into `strategy/brief.md` under
the Define section, and advances `strategy/STATE.md` to the next stage.

The loop iterates: if this stage changes the user's mind about an earlier one, it points
them back rather than forcing forward.
