# AGENTS.md — Kenzie Creative marketplace

Guidance for any agent (Claude Code, Cowork, or otherwise) working **on** this repository. This is the marketplace-level file; each plugin has its own `AGENTS.md` with plugin-specific detail.

> A plugin's `templates/CLAUDE.md` is a different thing: it's the per-deployment config file the plugin ships to *users*, not agent guidance. Don't conflate the two.

## What this is

A Claude plugin marketplace published from one GitHub repo (`kenziecreative/kenzie-creative`), hosting a family of small, focused plugins. Owner: Kelsey Ruger. License: MIT.

Install: `/plugin marketplace add kenziecreative/kenzie-creative`, then `/plugin install <plugin>@kenzie-creative`.

## Plugins (current versions)

- **goal-setting** (0.1.0) — a business goal-setting method in two arcs: a six-stage Setup Arc + a five-cadence Ongoing Arc over a Markdown `goals/` state dir, with a three-goal-rule hard cap and a goal-formulation critic. *Standalone.*
- **intelligence-briefing** (0.3.0) — a daily/weekly environmental brief that triages the outside world into a self-contained HTML brief. *Triage-stream.*
- **photo-generator** (1.2.0) — a guided photography director: plain-language scene → physics-aware Nano Banana Pro prompt (camera, lens, lighting, grade from a bundled reference library), optionally rendered via the Gemini API; batch, variations, and a refinement loop. *Standalone.*
- **researcher** (1.4.1) — a structured, audited research system. *Standalone.*
- **sage** (0.2.0) — meeting-transcript triage into a single living weekly round-up. *Standalone.*
- **strategist** (0.4.0) — a seven-stage strategic-thinking loop over a 70-framework library, with a reasoning critic; outputs a working record plus a clean reader-facing brief. *Standalone.*
- **thinkers** (0.1.0) — a reasoning counselor over a 243-pattern corpus (biases, fallacies, persuasion/manipulation tactics, bad-faith moves, strategies); five skills — identify, explain, practice, decide, spar — that name what's happening without over-applying high-stakes labels. *Standalone.*

The marketplace also carries an internal **`eval/`** runtime-QA harness (not a published plugin — see "Evaluating plugins").

Two author-side shapes (not surfaced to users as taxonomy): **triage-stream** plugins are small, recurring, and can compose through the `/contract` convention; **standalone systems** are heavier, project-shaped, and self-contained.

## How plugins compose (the `/contract` convention)

Shared state lives in the **deployment directory** (the project where a plugin runs), never inside a plugin — installed plugins are copied to a cache and can't read each other. The files: `ledger.json` (what's already been reported), `candidates.json` (review queue; rows tagged by a `source` field), `sources/` (drop-box inbox). Any plugin creates them if absent (with the Write tool, never shell), reads/prunes only its own `source` rows, and makes additive changes only. No plugin depends on another being installed. Canonical spec: `contract/README.md` (author documentation, not loaded at runtime).

## Build model

Every plugin must work on **both Claude Code and Cowork**. Surface-specific mechanics are owned by the tool that can actually see them:

- **Claude Code = executor.** Writes the code, resolves Claude-Code mechanics (hooks, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `.claude/settings.json` pre-allow, manifest entries), owns git.
- **Cowork = reviewer + spec owner.** Reviews build plans and diffs against intent, tests the Cowork surface, owns the adopter-facing register (READMEs, marketplace descriptions, setup copy).

Verification is split, not duplicated — each surface is tested by the only tool that can see it. A single code executor avoids split-brain edits.

## Working in Cowork (the real constraints)

- **File deletion is gated per folder.** Until you approve it (a delete prompt appears the first time), `rm` and git's own lock-cleanup fail with `Operation not permitted` on the FUSE mount — even on files you just created. Approve once and both `rm` and sandbox `git` work normally for that folder. This — not "git is broken in Cowork" — is why earlier sessions saw commits leave stale `.git/*.lock` files behind.
- **git tag/push is still safest from a real terminal** (network + credentials), but commits and tags work from the Cowork sandbox once deletion is enabled for the folder.
- **Setup commands use Read/Write/Edit/Glob, never shell** (`mkdir`/`ls`/`cat`) — shell triggers permission prompts. To create a folder, write a file into its path.

## Credential hygiene (binds every agent working in this repo)

Never read, print, echo, or copy the **value** of any credential (API key, token) — not from `.env` files, not from the environment, not between files, not into tests or chat. Plugins that need keys use a beacon pattern: the *user* pastes the value into a local key file directly; agents only ever check *presence* via a mechanism that reports the source without the value (e.g. photo-generator's `--check-keys`). If a legacy key file is found during a port or build, report its path to the user and let them migrate it themselves — the photo-generator v1.1.0 build agent silently copying a key between files is the incident this rule exists to prevent.

## Dev docs & work state

- **`dev/STATE.md` is the cross-session work snapshot** — where each plugin stands, what's in flight, the next-steps queue, open decisions, and session-only knowledge. Read it when picking up work; it's written by the `/checkpoint` skill (`.claude/skills/checkpoint/`), which any session should run before clearing context so nothing lives only in conversation. It's a snapshot, not a log — overwrite it; git history holds old versions.
- **Build/grounding docs live at repo-root `dev/<plugin>/`**, not in the plugin — a PRD and any build-orientation notes go in `dev/<plugin>/` so they don't ship in the installed plugin's cache (e.g. `dev/sage/`). Dev scaffolding (`.planning/`, `tests/`, `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`, logs) never ships either.
- **No plugin-root `CLAUDE.md`.** A `CLAUDE.md` at a plugin's root isn't loaded as context and draws a `claude plugin validate` warning. The shipped `templates/CLAUDE.md` is a different thing — it's the per-deployment config the plugin installs into the user's project, and it's fine. Build orientation goes in `dev/<plugin>/`, not the plugin root.
- **`.claude/` is marketplace-tooling only** (the `/checkpoint` skill, `settings.local.json`) — it is not shipped to users and not part of any plugin. Note: in Cowork the Write tool blocks writes under `.claude/`; create files there with the bash tool.

## Release & versioning

- `plugin.json` `version` is the **single source of truth** for update propagation (not the git tag).
- Per-plugin semver. The version is mirrored by hand in four places; **`node dev/scripts/check-version-prefix.mjs` guards all four** and fails on drift (or on a plugin missing from an index), so let it be the backstop rather than trusting yourself to catch every spot. Loop: edit → bump `version` → **update the `v<X.Y.Z> — ` prefix in BOTH descriptions (`plugin.json` and the plugin's entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)** → update the plugin's version in the root README "Plugins at a glance" table **and** the root `AGENTS.md` "Plugins (current versions)" list → CHANGELOG entry → `node dev/scripts/check-version-prefix.mjs` → `claude plugin validate ./<plugin>` and `claude plugin validate .` → optional authoring review (plugin-dev `skill-reviewer` / `plugin-validator`) → commit → tag → push.
- **Tags are plugin-scoped:** `sage-v0.2.0`, `researcher-v1.4.1`, `intelligence-briefing-v0.3.0`, `strategist-v0.3.0`, `plugin-eval-v0.1.0`. Legacy plain `vX.Y.Z` tags exist from early intelligence-briefing releases — don't reuse plain tags; they collide across plugins (there is already a plain `v0.2.0` and `v0.3.0`).
- Installers update via the Cowork Plugins tab, or Claude Code `/plugin marketplace update kenzie-creative` + `/plugin update <plugin>`.

**Why the version prefix is duplicated in the descriptions (UI workaround):** the marketplace card does not currently surface a plugin's `version` field — users see only the description. And there are two descriptions: the **browse cards render the catalog entry's description** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), while `plugin.json`'s description shows post-install. Both therefore start with `v<X.Y.Z> — ` so the version is visible everywhere. The risk is drift: bumping `version` without updating a prefix means the UI lies. `dev/scripts/check-version-prefix.mjs` asserts every place agrees — the `version` field, the `plugin.json` prefix, the catalog prefix, the README table cell, and the AGENTS list entry (and that no plugin is missing from those indexes) — and exits non-zero on drift; run it in the release loop above. **This is a temporary workaround** (borrowed from the Hello Alice marketplace); if the marketplace card surfaces version natively, strip the prefixes and remove this step.

## Evaluating plugins (internal)

QA has two halves. The **authoring** half — is a plugin well-formed and well-written — is the
release loop above (`check-version-prefix`, `claude plugin validate`, and plugin-dev's
`skill-reviewer`/`plugin-validator`). The **runtime** half — when you actually run it, is the
output good and does it communicate well — is the **`eval/`** harness: internal tooling, **not
a published plugin** (no manifest, not in the catalog). It drives a target plugin's real skills
blind through scripted scenarios, computes deterministic gates with `eval/lib/run-gates.mjs`,
and scores the capture with a separate judge against a per-target rubric. Run it with
`/eval-run --target <name>` after changing a plugin's skills; a red **golden** is a ship-blocker.
It grades whether the plugin *behaved* well, never whether its recommendation was *correct*.
Details and how to add a target: `eval/README.md` and `eval/AGENTS.md`. (Note: the
`eval-runner`/`eval-judge` agents live in `.claude/agents/` and need a session reload to
register after they're first added.)

## Cowork-safe HTML (for plugins that render HTML)

Learned the hard way: system fonts as the real basis (web fonts are progressive enhancement only); **no JavaScript**; **no content-hiding entrance animations** (a CSS `opacity:0` reveal renders blank if the viewer doesn't run animations); flat design — bordered cards on white, no drop shadows. Plugins stay brand-neutral; a deployment applies its own brand by pointing a `theme` at a local CSS override.

## Adding a new plugin

Run **`/new-plugin`** (the marketplace skill at `.claude/skills/new-plugin/`). It scaffolds a
fully-conformant tree from the templates in that skill's `references/` — full `plugin.json`
metadata, the standard `AGENTS.md` skeleton with a `## Maintaining this plugin` section, a
README, a CHANGELOG opened at `0.1.0`, and a starter command + skill — then **registers the
plugin in all three root indexes** (`marketplace.json`, the README "Plugins at a glance"
table, and the "Plugins (current versions)" list above) and validates. A scaffolded plugin
passes `check-version-prefix.mjs` and `claude plugin validate .` with no manual cleanup.

If scaffolding by hand instead: the three registration points are the easy ones to forget —
the checker now fails when a plugin is missing from the README table or the AGENTS list, so
run it. New plugins start at `0.1.0`, tagged `<name>-v0.1.0`.

## Per-plugin detail

Each plugin's own `AGENTS.md` carries its structure, mechanics, locked decisions, surface
differences, and a `## Maintaining this plugin` section (the release ritual + that plugin's
edit cautions): `goal-setting/AGENTS.md`, `intelligence-briefing/AGENTS.md`, `photo-generator/AGENTS.md`,
`researcher/AGENTS.md`, `sage/AGENTS.md`, `strategist/AGENTS.md`, `thinkers/AGENTS.md`.
