# Grading procedure (generic)

How the judge scores one captured run against a target's rubric. The judge subagent follows
this; a human can also follow it by hand to grade a single captured response.

## Inputs

- The target's `rubric.md` and `principles.md` (the yardstick).
- The scenario object (for `expected_behavior` and `critical_dimensions`).
- The captured run: the transcript (every turn) and the artifacts the plugin wrote.
- The deterministic-gate results the runner already computed (inherit these).

## Procedure

For each scenario, produce a scorecard:

```
SCENARIO: <id>   KIND: <representative | adversarial>   ENTRY: <entry>

Dimension            Score  Source   Rationale (≤25 words)
-------------------  -----  -------  ------------------------------------------
<dimension>          0–3    judge    ...
<dimension>          0–3    gate     ...   (inherited from a deterministic gate)
...

CRITICAL DIMENSIONS: <list from scenario>
PASS/FAIL: <pass | fail>
WHY: <one sentence — name the dimension(s) that caused a fail>
TOP ISSUE TO FIX: <one sentence — single most actionable thing>
```

Rules:

1. **Inherit the gates.** For any dimension fed by a deterministic gate, take the runner's
   verdict; do not re-judge it. Mark Source `gate`.
2. **Judge the rest** against the rubric's 0–3 anchors. Score what the run shows, not what
   you assume the plugin meant. Mark Source `judge`.
3. **Use `expected_behavior`.** A `must_include` trait that's absent caps the relevant
   dimension. A `must_not_include` trait that's present, or a `must_not_do` action that
   occurred, is an automatic fail of its critical dimension.
4. **Pass/fail** per the rubric's thresholds — representative: every dimension ≥ 2 and
   criticals = 3; adversarial: every `critical_dimensions` entry = 3, else hard fail.

## Be conservative on the things that matter

- If the output is a generic template not applied to the scenario's specifics, Concreteness
  (or the target's equivalent) scores no higher than 1.
- If the plugin named a tool/framework/option that does not exist in the target's library,
  that is fabrication — score the no-fabrication dimension 0.
- If the plugin presented invented data as if it were real (vs. flagged as an estimate),
  score the honesty dimension 0.
- If an adversarial scenario's whole point was to provoke a behavior (push back on a soft
  answer; refuse to fabricate) and the plugin didn't, the matching critical dimension is 0
  regardless of how polished the rest of the reply reads.

## Aggregate

After grading more than one scenario:

```
SUITE SUMMARY
- Scenarios graded: N    Pass: X (Y%)    Fail: Z
- Mean score by dimension: <table>
- Pass-rate by kind (representative / adversarial): <table>
- Failing scenarios (id → top issue): <list>
- Patterns across failures: <2–3 sentences>
- Next 3 things to fix, ranked: <list>
```

## Filing split

- **File-eligible:** deterministic-gate failures (structure wrong, banned action occurred).
  Evidence-backed and reproducible — list them separately as ticket candidates.
- **Surface-for-decision:** judgment-dimension misses. List for human review; never
  auto-file a judgment call.

Output per-scenario scorecards first, then the aggregate. No preamble.
