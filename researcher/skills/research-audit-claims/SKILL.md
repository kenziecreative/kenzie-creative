name: research-audit-claims
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to audit, fact-check, or verify the claims in a research draft before it ships, or to promote a draft to outputs (e.g. "audit this draft", "fact-check phase 2", "can this go to outputs"). Walks every claim against its cited source notes and, if it passes, logs the gate row and promotes the draft from research/drafts/ to research/outputs/.

# /research:audit-claims

Audit a research draft for unsupported claims. If the audit passes, promote the draft from `research/drafts/` to `research/outputs/`. If it fails, the draft stays in `drafts/` until issues are fixed and the audit is re-run.

## Input
The user will provide a filepath to audit (should be a file in `research/drafts/`).

## Process

1. **Read the file to audit.**
2. **Read `research/reference/source-standards.md`** for evidence rules.
3. **Read `research/reference/writing-standards.md`** for precision preservation and synthesis rules.
4. **Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/evidence-failure-modes.md`** for the catalog of evidence degradation patterns. Check for each pattern type during the audit.
4a. **Read the project's commissioned evidence standard.** Read `research/reference/evidence-standard.md` (written by `/research:init`). If it does not exist (project predates the convention), fall back to the "Audience & Evidence Standard" section of the project's `CLAUDE.md`. If neither exists, note in the audit report: "No audience evidence standard on file — standard gate inactive for this project" and skip the standard checks below. The standard's Enforceable Rules are part of this audit's pass/fail criteria — see "Audience-standard violations" under Pass/Fail Criteria.
4b. **Read the waivers already standing against this draft.** Read the existing audit report at `research/audits/<basename>-audit.md` (if one exists from a prior audit) and the draft's Methodology & Limitations section. Collect every waiver recorded for this draft — each names a claim and carries the commissioner's rationale verbatim. A finding covered by a standing waiver is still found and still reported (it appears in the findings table, marked `waived`), but it does not fail the draft. A waiver covers only the claim it names: it does not carry to a different claim, or to a different violation on the same claim. If a waived claim has changed materially since the waiver was granted — the figure moved, the sourcing changed — the waiver has lapsed: report the violation as open and say why.
5. **For every factual claim in the document:**
   - Does it trace to a file in `research/notes/` or a previous phase output? If yes, note the source.
   - Is the claim accurately represented? Check against the source note — same numbers, same ranges, same qualifiers.
   - Is the confidence language appropriate given the number of supporting sources?
   - Are contradicting sources acknowledged?
   - Is dated information flagged if older than 2 years?
   - Are ranges preserved fully? (not narrowed, not midpointed)
   - Are qualifiers from the source preserved? (not dropped during compression)
   - If a number is carried from a previous phase, does it match the original exactly?
   - Does the claim comply with every Enforceable Rule in the project's evidence standard (step 4a)? Example: if the standard says "single-source financial claims are unacceptable," a financial figure traced to one source note is an **Audience-standard violation** — accurately cited or not.
   - For every contradiction resolution in `research/cross-reference.md` that this claim rests on, compare the recorded `user_resolution` against the recorded `suggested_resolution`. If they differ — regardless of what the `user_override` flag says (the flag corroborates; the field comparison decides) — the draft must visibly label the override at the finding site AND list it in the Methodology & Limitations section. An overridden resolution presented as if the evidence produced it is **Override undisclosed**. A resolution record missing either field is itself a finding: the resolution is not properly recorded, and claims resting on it cannot be verified against it.
   - For Person Research and Customer Safari projects: is every real person other than the commissioned research subject anonymized (no names, handles, or identifying detail) unless a source note records explicit permission? An identifiable non-subject individual is **Identity exposure**. Real specificity, not real identity — the fail direction is over-anonymization.
5b. **Methodology & Limitations structural check.** The draft must end with a `## Methodology & Limitations` section, and the section must be real — populated for THIS draft, not boilerplate. Verify each element:
   - **Sampling disclosure present**, with properly scoped absence language: "not found via the mapped channels," never "does not exist."
   - **Single-source findings list** consistent with what this audit itself found — a finding the audit traced to one independent source must appear here (or the draft must gain it as a mechanical fix).
   - **Commissioner overrides listed**, matching the field comparison in step 5 — every resolution whose `user_resolution` differs from its `suggested_resolution` appears.
   - **Counter-evidence status** (PRD Validation and Exploratory Thesis only): either the credible challenger(s) cited, or the documented-adverse-search stamp. **When the stamp is present, verify the record behind it:** `research/discovery/negative-searches.md` must contain a matching entry for this phase (queries, channels, acknowledgment). A stamp with no matching record is an unsupported claim about the research process itself — high severity; the stamp comes out or the valve is run properly.
   - **Waiver lines** for every waiver standing against this draft (step 4b) — granted during an audit or recorded between audits. A waiver on record whose rationale is not in the M&L verbatim is a recording failure, not a mechanical fix to paper over: write the line, and say you did.

   A missing section, a missing sampling disclosure, or a stamp without its record fails the draft (classification: **Methodology omission**). A missing-but-derivable element (the sampling disclosure, a single-source list the audit just computed) is a mechanical fix — apply it per the FAIL sequence. A missing negative-search record is never mechanical: the audit cannot invent the search.
6. **Cross-document consistency check:** If other files already exist in `research/outputs/` or `research/drafts/`, check whether this draft and those documents cite the same numbers for the same claims. Flag any inconsistencies.
6a. **Canonical figures check:** Read `research/reference/canonical-figures.json`. If the file does not exist, note "No canonical figures registry yet — first phase of this research project or registry not yet populated. Skipping this check; it will activate once figures are registered." and continue to step 7. If the file exists but fails to parse as JSON, stop the audit and tell the user: "`research/reference/canonical-figures.json` exists but cannot be parsed as JSON. This is a registry corruption — restore from git or fix the file manually before re-running the audit. Do not promote the draft." Do not proceed until the file is valid. If the file exists and parses correctly, for every number in the draft that exists in the canonical registry, verify it matches exactly. Flag any discrepancy as high-severity.

   **Drift detection (claim graph):** If `research/reference/claim-graph.json` exists and parses correctly, walk every claim node whose `figure_ids` array is non-empty. For each figure ID listed, look up the current value in the canonical-figures.json registry (already read above). If the registry value differs from the value stored when the claim was written (detectable when the claim text contains a specific figure that no longer matches the canonical value), annotate the claim node with a `drift_warning` object:
   ```json
   {
     "figure_id": "<id from figure_ids>",
     "expected_value": "<value stored in claim at last audit>",
     "canonical_value": "<current registry value>"
   }
   ```
   Write the annotated claim-graph.json back to disk. Do not alter the claim's `confidence_tier`. Collect all drift warnings for reporting in the findings table (step 7) and scorecard (step 8). If claim-graph.json does not exist or fails to parse, skip drift detection without comment — the graph is supplementary infrastructure; its absence does not block the audit.

   **Transitive detection:** Drift is resolved in the same read pass — a figure ID may appear in multiple claim nodes. Flag all nodes referencing a revised figure; no separate traversal step is needed because `figure_ids` is a flat array on each node.

   **Error handling:** If claim-graph.json exists but fails to parse as JSON, log a warning and skip drift detection — do not fail the audit. After writing drift_warning annotations back to disk, re-read the file and confirm it parses as valid JSON. If the write verification fails, log: "WARNING: claim-graph.json drift annotation write failed" and continue the audit.

7. **Classify each issue found:**
   - **Unsupported claim** — No source note backs this up
   - **Misrepresented** — Source says something different than what's claimed
   - **Missing attribution** — Claim is supportable but citation is missing
   - **Stale data** — Information may be outdated
   - **Contradiction ignored** — Sources disagree but only one side is presented
   - **Range narrowed** — Source range was compressed or midpointed
   - **Qualifier dropped** — Source qualification was lost in compression
   - **Number drift** — Figure doesn't match the cited source
   - **Cross-document inconsistency** — Same claim, different figures across documents
   - **Drift detected** — A canonical figure this claim references has changed since the claim was written; `drift_warning` field has been set on the claim node in claim-graph.json
   - **Audience-standard violation** — The claim breaches an Enforceable Rule in the project's commissioned evidence standard (high-severity; promotable only under a named waiver — see Pass/Fail Criteria)
   - **Override undisclosed** — A `user_override=true` contradiction resolution reaches the draft without a visible commissioner-override label (high-severity)
   - **Identity exposure** — A real person other than the research subject is identifiable in the draft with no recorded permission (Person Research / Customer Safari; high-severity)
   - **Methodology omission** — The Methodology & Limitations section is missing, lacks the sampling disclosure, or carries an adverse-search stamp with no matching negative-search record (high-severity; see step 5b for which fixes are mechanical)
8. **Generate audit scorecard:**
   - Total specific claims checked: N
   - Claims traced to source: N (X%)
   - Claims matching source value and context: N (X%)
   - Claims with appropriate qualifiers: N (X%)
   - Issues found: N mismatches, N unsourced, N drift, N range narrowed
   - Severity distribution: N high, N moderate, N low

   - Drift warnings: N claims referencing figures that have changed since last audit
     (claim IDs: [id1, id2, ...] — review canonical-figures.json for current values)

   Section confidence tiers (weakest-link per section from claim graph):
   - [Section name]: [minimum tier among claims in this section] — weakest claim: [claim id], [rationale]
   - [Section name]: [minimum tier] — weakest claim: [claim id], [rationale]

   Tier ordering: Insufficient (0) < Low (1) < Moderate (2) < High (3). For each section, group claim nodes by `section` field from claim-graph.json, take the minimum `confidence_tier` value. The node with the lowest score is the weakest link for that section.

   Overall confidence: [minimum tier across all sections] (weakest-link determines overall)

8a. **Compute per-section confidence tier:**

   For each section of the draft, assess four inputs and produce a named tier (High / Moderate / Low / Insufficient):

   **Four inputs:**
   1. **Source count** — How many independent sources back this section's claims? Map to pattern-recognition-guide levels: Claim (1 source), Emerging (2–3 sources), Pattern (4+ sources). Echo-level sources (dependent sources sharing a common origin as identified during cross-reference) count as one, not multiple.
   2. **Credibility tiers** — What is the highest credibility tier among the section's sources (from source-assessment-guide.md)? A mix of credibility tiers is stronger than uniform low-tier coverage.
   3. **Evidence directness** — Are sources directly addressing the claim, or are they adjacent/inferred? Direct = source explicitly states the finding. Indirect = finding is inferred from related data, extrapolated, or adjacent to the claim.
   4. **Staleness** — What proportion of the section's sources exceed the research type's staleness threshold (defined in the type template from process-source)? Majority stale = downgrade.

   **Confidence tier definitions:**
   - **High**: 4+ independent sources from credible tiers (official docs, analyst reports, peer-reviewed), majority direct evidence, no stale sources dominating
   - **Moderate**: 2–3 independent sources with at least one credible-tier source, mostly direct evidence, stale sources are minority
   - **Low**: 1–2 sources, or sources are primarily low-credibility (vendor marketing, blog posts), or evidence is mostly indirect, or stale sources dominate
   - **Insufficient**: 0–1 sources for a section's claims, or all sources are the same low credibility tier with no triangulation

   **Tier computation approach:**
   - Start at the source-count level: Claim → Low, Emerging → Moderate, Pattern → High
   - Upgrade if credibility is strong (all high-tier sources) or evidence is entirely direct
   - Downgrade if credibility is weak (no high-tier sources), evidence is mostly indirect, or stale sources dominate
   - Cap at Insufficient if fewer than 2 sources with no high-credibility source

   Record the tier and a one-sentence rationale for each section. Add to the scorecard output (step 8) after severity distribution.

8b. **Write claim graph nodes to `research/reference/claim-graph.json`.**

   For every factual claim traced in step 5, construct a claim node using the data already in context:
   - `id` — sequential prefix (c001, c002, ...) + slug from first 4-5 words of claim text (lowercase, hyphenated, non-alphanumeric stripped). Example: `"c001-market-size-exceeds-four"`. Sequential prefix guarantees uniqueness; slug makes IDs human-scannable.
   - `text` — the claim text as traced in step 5
   - `phase` — current phase number (read from `research/STATE.md` `Active phase` field)
   - `section` — section name from the audit pass
   - `confidence_tier` — tier computed in step 8a for this claim's section (High / Moderate / Low / Insufficient)
   - `source_files` — array of note filenames traced in step 5
   - `figure_ids` — array of figure IDs from canonical-figures.json that appear in this claim (empty array `[]` if none)
   - `evidence_directness` — Direct / Indirect classification from step 8a
   - `source_count` — integer count of independent sources from step 8a

   Read `research/reference/claim-graph.json`. If the file does not exist, create it with `{"claims": []}`. If it exists but fails to parse as JSON, log a warning in the audit report and skip the graph write — do not fail the audit.

   For claims already present in the graph (matched by `phase` + `section` + `text` equality), overwrite the existing node with the new data. For new claims, append to the `claims` array.

   **Drift warning lifecycle:** On re-audit, the drift detection pass in step 6a evaluates all figure_ids against the current canonical registry before step 8b runs. If a previously drifted figure now matches (drift resolved), the node written here will have no `drift_warning` field. If drift persists, the `drift_warning` set by step 6a will be included in the overwritten node. Step 8b does not independently manage drift_warning — it inherits whatever state step 6a established for each node.

   Write the updated JSON back to `research/reference/claim-graph.json`.

   **After writing, verify the write succeeded.** Re-read the file and confirm it parses as valid JSON with a `claims` array. If the read fails or the array is missing, log: "WARNING: claim-graph.json write failed — graph incomplete for this phase. Re-run `/research:audit-claims` to retry graph write without re-running the full audit." Do not fail the audit or block promotion.

9. **Write audit report to `research/audits/<basename>-audit.md`**, where `<basename>` is the draft's filename with its `.md` extension stripped — `research/drafts/04-test-section.md` audits to `research/audits/04-test-section-audit.md`, not `04-test-section.md-audit.md`. Include: scorecard, pass/fail determination, findings table, list of claims that need correction, and the confidence tier table (section name, tier, rationale) from step 8a.

   **After writing, verify the write succeeded.** Re-read the file path you just wrote and confirm it exists and contains the scorecard, findings table, and confidence tier table sections. If the read fails or any of those sections is missing, do not report "audit report written" — surface the write failure to the user with the exact path that failed, and do not advance to the pass/fail step until the write is confirmed.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

A draft passes when:
- Zero high-severity issues (unsupported claims, misrepresented data, number drift, undisclosed overrides, identity exposure, methodology omissions)
- The Methodology & Limitations section exists and passes the step 5b structural check
- Zero unwaived audience-standard violations (see below)
- Zero moderate-severity issues left unresolved (range narrowed, qualifier dropped, cross-document inconsistency)
- 100% of specific numerical claims trace to a source note or phase output with a matching value
- Low-severity issues (missing attribution, stale data) are acceptable if documented in the audit report

There is no percentage threshold. Every specific claim must check out. The scorecard is for visibility into the draft's quality, not for setting a "good enough" bar.

**Audience-standard violations fail by default — a named waiver is the only other exit.** The evidence standard captured at init is a contract the user commissioned; enforcing it is user sovereignty, not agent paternalism. When a violation is found, present it and the two options: fix the claim (add sources, cut it, or requalify it), or grant a waiver. A waiver requires the user's own words in the format `waive: <claim or finding> — <rationale>` — do not draft the rationale for them, and do not accept "just waive it" without one. Waivers are per-claim, never blanket. A draft with an unwaived standard violation does not promote.

A waiver is recorded the moment it is granted, in all three loci — audit report, gate-log Detail, and the draft's Methodology & Limitations verbatim (`Waiver (commissioner): "<rationale>" — applies to: <claim>`). Most waivers arrive as a bare message after a failed audit, with no audit running; record them then, on that turn. See "Waiver Arriving Between Audits" below.

Only audience-standard violations are waivable. The standard gate has a waiver exit because the user commissioned the standard and can amend their own contract. Evidence accuracy has no such exit — an unsupported claim, a misrepresented source, a number that doesn't match its note, an undisclosed override, or an identity exposure cannot be waived by anyone. If the user tries, say which of the two kinds of finding they are looking at and why this one has no waiver door.

**Confidence tiers are advisory — they indicate evidence strength, not audit compliance.** A section can be High confidence and fail (misrepresented claim) or Low confidence and pass (single source but accurately cited). A Low-confidence section that passes the audit is promoted with its tier visible in the audit report. Do not use confidence tier as a reason to fail or hold a draft — with one exception: a rule the project's own evidence standard declares (step 4a) is enforced at this gate. That is not tier-based grading; it is the standard the user themselves set at init, applied where it was always meant to apply.

## After Audit

- **If PASS:**
  1. **Promote the draft.** This is a two-step operation: append a gate-log row first, then move the file.

     But first, understand what a passing audit does and does not do: it promotes ONE file. It does not by itself end the phase — that requires the full deliverable manifest (step 2).

     1a. **Append a row to `research/audits/gate-log.md`.** The hook gate on `research/outputs/` reads this log to authorize the move (Claude Code only; the hook is inert in Cowork). Use the Edit tool to append a single row to the gate-log table. Row format (no leading spaces, single-line):

         ```
         | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | promote | pass | research/outputs/<filename> | from research/drafts/<filename> |
         ```

         The timestamp must be current and in UTC with a trailing `Z` (format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). The `File` column path is project-relative (no `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` prefix). The filename in both columns is the draft's basename — promotion preserves the filename across the move.

         The gate hook authorizes a write to `research/outputs/<filename>` only when the most recent gate-log row's timestamp is within 120 seconds, the result column is `pass`, and the file column matches the write target. Append the row immediately before the move — any delay risks the 120s window expiring.

     1b. **Move the file from `research/drafts/<filename>` to `research/outputs/<filename>`.** Prefer Bash `mv` (single operation, atomic on the same filesystem) over a Read+Write+delete sequence. The hook gates Write/Edit/MultiEdit, not Bash, so `mv` proceeds without consulting the gate-log — the row written in 1a is the durable audit record of the authorization decision regardless.
  2. **Deliverable manifest check — close against the whole contract.** Read `research/research-plan.md` and list every output the current phase promises: the phase's `**Output:**` line, or the full `**Outputs:**` list for a synthesis phase (e.g., executive summary + final report + recommendations). For each promised deliverable, check two things: the file exists in `research/outputs/`, and a passing audit report for it exists in `research/audits/`. Present the manifest as a short table: deliverable | in outputs/ | audited.

     - **All promised deliverables exist and are audited:** the phase's contract is met — proceed to step 3 (phase closeout).
     - **Any promised deliverable is missing or unaudited:** do NOT close the phase. Leave the phase active in STATE.md with Synthesize/Verify unchecked (the cycle is not done until the whole inventory is), and rewrite `Next Action` to the next concrete step, e.g.: `Run /research:summarize-section <next-deliverable> for Phase N — 2 of 3 promised deliverables remain: <list>.` Tell the user exactly which deliverables remain and confirm the one just promoted. Do not present the phase debrief — the debrief marks phase completion, and the phase is not complete. Stop here.

     One audited executive summary does not close a synthesis phase that promised a report and recommendations. The final-phase branch in step 3 is subject to the same rule: "all phases complete" cannot be declared while any promised deliverable of the final phase is missing or unaudited.

  3. **Close out the phase in `research/STATE.md`.** A passing audit that completes the phase's deliverable manifest (step 2) is the end of the current phase's cycle. STATE.md must be advanced *before* the debrief so that any subsequent `/clear` leaves the project in a correct state — the user may jump straight to `/research:discover` on resume without running `/research:start-phase`, and `discover`'s pre-check depends on "Active phase" already pointing at Phase N+1.

     Perform all of the following writes in a single STATE.md update:
     - **Check off Verify.** In `Current Phase Cycle → Phase N`, change `- [ ] **Verify** …` to `- [x] **Verify** …`. Confirm all five steps (Collect, Connect, Assess, Synthesize, Verify) are now checked. If any earlier step is still unchecked, **verify artifacts before prompting the user.** For each unchecked step, check whether the expected artifact exists and is current:
       - **Collect:** Phase N source notes exist in `research/notes/` (grep for `phase: N` or check filenames) AND corresponding entries exist in `research/sources/registry.md`.
       - **Connect:** `research/cross-reference.md` contains Phase N cross-reference data (check for Phase N heading or entries citing Phase N sources).
       - **Assess:** `research/gaps.md` contains a coverage assessment for Phase N.
       - **Synthesize:** A draft for Phase N exists in `research/drafts/`.

       If the artifacts confirm the step was completed (the expected files exist with Phase N content), this is a checkbox-only discrepancy caused by a context clear — silently mark the step checked and continue the closeout. Log one line per reconciled step: "Reconciled [Step]: artifacts confirm completion (e.g., 10 Phase N notes in registry, cross-reference.md updated YYYY-MM-DD)."

       Only prompt the user when **artifacts are missing or ambiguous** — e.g., no Phase N notes exist, cross-reference.md has no Phase N data, or gaps.md doesn't cover Phase N. In that case, present three named options: **(a) cancel the closeout and re-run the missing cycle step** (the user goes back to run the relevant skill for whichever step lacks artifacts, then re-invokes audit-claims); **(b) authorize marking the step checked anyway** (the user confirms the step was completed through means not reflected in the standard artifacts); **(c) abort the audit promotion entirely and leave the draft in drafts/** (the audit report is still written, but the draft is not promoted and STATE.md is not advanced). Wait for the user to pick one. Do not proceed until they do, and do not leave STATE.md half-updated.
     - **Mark the phase complete in Completed Phases.** Change `- [ ] Phase N: [Name]` to `- [x] Phase N: [Name] — COMPLETE [YYYY-MM-DD]`.
     - **Read `research/research-plan.md`** to determine Phase N+1's name. If Phase N was the final phase in the plan, skip to the "final phase" branch below.
     - **Advance `Active phase`** in `Current Position` from `N — [Phase N Name]` to `N+1 — [Phase N+1 Name]`.
     - **Reset `Cycle step`** to `Collect (1 of 5)`.
     - **Reset `Blocking on`** to `Nothing — ready to start.` (unless a real blocker carried over, in which case preserve it and note the phase transition).
     - **Replace the Current Phase Cycle block** with a fresh Phase N+1 cycle checklist, all five steps unchecked, using the same format as the Phase 1 template in `/research:init`:

       ```markdown
       ### Phase N+1: [Name]
       - [ ] **Collect** — Sources gathered for this phase's questions (start with /research:discover)
       - [ ] **Connect** — `/research:cross-ref` run, cross-reference.md current
       - [ ] **Assess** — `/research:check-gaps` run, coverage confirmed for this phase
       - [ ] **Synthesize** — `/research:summarize-section` run, draft in `drafts/`, integrity checked
       - [ ] **Verify** — `/research:audit-claims` passed, output promoted to `outputs/`
       ```

       The completed Phase N checklist is NOT preserved in `Current Phase Cycle` — its record lives in `Completed Phases`. `Current Phase Cycle` always reflects exactly one active phase.
     - **Reset `Sources Processed` counters for the new phase:**
       - `Sources for current phase: 0`
       - Leave `Total count`, `Sources since last cross-reference`, `Last cross-reference`, and `Last gap check` as-is — those are project-wide or will be reset by their respective skills.
     - **Update `Next Action`** to a specific executable command for Phase N+1. Prefer:

       ```
       Run /research:start-phase to brief Phase N+1, or /research:discover to jump straight to source collection. No sources collected yet for Phase N+1.
       ```

       `Next Action` must be a concrete command the user can execute after a fresh session load, not a phase-level description.

     **Final phase branch.** If Phase N was the final phase in the research plan — and ONLY if the step 2 manifest confirmed every deliverable the final phase promises exists in `research/outputs/` with a passing audit:
     - Set `Active phase: — all phases complete`.
     - Set `Cycle step: — all cycles complete`.
     - Do NOT generate a new Current Phase Cycle block — remove it or replace it with `*(No active phase — all phases complete.)*`.
     - Update `Next Action` to: `Run /research:progress to review the full project dashboard. Consider running /research:check-gaps one final time to confirm no unresolved items before wrap-up.`

  4. **Append backstage tasks for the next phase.** Before the debrief, append to `research/reference/backstage-tasks.md` (create with its header if absent) any private prep items this phase surfaced for future work — a figure that looked shaky and deserves a re-check, a suspected shared-origin cluster to trace, a source type the next phase should prioritize. These are the agent's own homework, not user-facing actions: `/research:start-phase` reads and works through them silently at the next phase start. Do not narrate this write to the user or read the list aloud — if an item is worth the user's attention, it belongs in the debrief instead. If nothing warrants an entry, write nothing.

  5. **Present the phase debrief** (see below). The debrief runs *after* STATE.md is advanced, not before.

- **If FAIL:** Do not promote the draft. Do not touch STATE.md. Execute the following steps in order — do not stop after step 1:

  1. **Classify each issue as mechanical or judgment.**
     - *Mechanical:* the correct value or wording is already knowable from the source notes, canonical-figures.json, or an analogous fix already made elsewhere in the same draft. Examples: misattributed range, typo'd figure, wrong citation pointing at a note that exists, qualifier strip that matches canonical data.
     - *Judgment:* choosing between two plausible sources, rewriting a claim whose support is missing entirely, resolving a contradiction the draft got wrong. Audience-standard violations are always judgment issues — only the user can decide between fixing the claim and granting a waiver.

  2. **Apply every mechanical fix to the draft now.** Do not ask permission. Use the Edit tool to make each change in the draft file. This is not optional — if a fix is mechanical, apply it.

  3. **List what you did and what remains.** For each mechanical fix applied, show: file, line, before → after. For each judgment issue, describe what needs to change and why the user must decide.

  4. **Tell the user to re-run the audit.** End by handing the re-run back — and say only what is true of this audit:
     - Mechanical fixes were applied → "Fixes applied. Re-run `/research:audit-claims <filepath>` to verify."
     - No mechanical fixes existed (every finding is a judgment call — an audience-standard violation always is) → do NOT claim fixes were applied. End with: "No mechanical fixes to apply — the open findings need your decision. Re-run `/research:audit-claims <filepath>` once they're resolved."

     Never auto-re-run — re-audit is always user-invoked so each audit is a fresh, full check (fixes can introduce new problems). If the user's next message is a waiver rather than a re-run, follow "Waiver Arriving Between Audits" below: record it, then hand the re-run back to them.

## Waiver Arriving Between Audits

A waiver almost never arrives during an audit. It arrives after one — the user reads the findings, decides a violation is a risk they will carry, and types `waive: <claim> — <rationale>` as a bare message. No audit is running when it lands.

**Record it on that turn.** Recording is not re-auditing. "Never auto-re-run" restrains the audit loop; it says nothing about the record, and the two must not be confused. A waiver accepted in conversation and written to no file is the user exercising control that leaves no trace — indistinguishable, a week later, from having been ignored. Deferring the write to a re-audit that may never happen is not caution; it is the failure.

When a `waive:` message arrives outside an audit run:

1. **Validate it.** The message must carry the user's own rationale in the format `waive: <claim or finding> — <rationale>`. "Just waive it," "fine, ship it," or a bare `waive:` with no rationale is not a waiver — re-ask with the format and record nothing. Never author the rationale.

   It must also name a finding on record. Read the audit report at `research/audits/<basename>-audit.md`. If no audit report exists, or it holds no open audience-standard violation this waiver could address, say so and ask the user to run `/research:audit-claims <filepath>` first — a waiver against nothing is not recorded. If the finding it names is real but not an audience-standard violation, it is not waivable (see Pass/Fail Criteria): tell the user which kind of finding it is and that evidence accuracy has no waiver exit.

2. **Scope it to what the rationale actually covers.** A waiver covers the finding(s) its rationale speaks to — not every finding open on the draft. If the audit found two violations and the rationale addresses one, the second stays open, and the draft still does not promote. Do not stretch the user's words to cover a finding they did not address, and do not ask them to re-type a waiver you could scope yourself. State plainly which findings the waiver clears and which remain.

3. **Record it in all three loci, now.**

   a. **Draft Methodology & Limitations** — insert the rationale verbatim: `Waiver (commissioner): "<rationale>" — applies to: <claim>`. If the section carries a `Waivers: none` placeholder, replace it. The draft is in `research/drafts/`, so Edit is ungated.

   b. **Audit report** (`research/audits/<basename>-audit.md`) — append or update a `## Waivers` section: date, the claim, the rationale verbatim, and which finding it clears. The finding stays in the findings table, marked `waived`. A waiver does not erase the violation; it sits next to it. The reader of the audit must be able to see both what was found and what the commissioner chose to carry.

   c. **Gate-log** (`research/audits/gate-log.md`) — append one row:

      ```
      | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | waive | waived | research/drafts/<filename> | <finding> — commissioner waiver: "<rationale>" |
      ```

      The Result column is `waived`, never `pass`: a waiver authorizes no promotion by itself, and the hook reads the most recent row. The File column points at the draft, which is where the file still is.

   After writing, re-read each of the three files and confirm the waiver text landed. If any write failed, say which one, with the path — do not report the waiver as recorded.

4. **Confirm, and hand the re-run back.** Tell the user what was recorded and where, which findings it clears, which remain open, and that the draft has not moved. Then stop: `Recorded. Re-run /research:audit-claims <filepath> to verify the draft against the standing waiver.` Do not re-run the audit, do not promote, do not touch STATE.md. The next audit reads the waiver at step 4b and will not fail the draft on the waived finding.

## Phase Debrief (after pass)

When a phase's audit passes, do NOT just say "Audit passed" and recommend clearing context. Present a comprehensive debrief of what the phase established. Read the promoted output file and present:

1. **Key findings** — The substantive things this phase established, with specifics (numbers, comparisons, named entities). Not a one-line summary — cover all the major findings, not just the headline.
2. **Surprises or counterintuitive results** — Anything that challenges assumptions or conventional wisdom.
3. **Gaps that remain** — What this phase couldn't answer and why (data doesn't exist, sources conflict, needs internal verification).
4. **Implications for upcoming phases** — How these findings shape what to look for next.

After presenting the debrief, pause and invite the user to react:

```
That's what Phase {N} established. Anything you want to capture, question, or dig into before we move on?
```

Wait for the user to respond. They may:
- Ask follow-up questions about specific findings
- Want to capture a note for later (`research/notes-to-self.md`)
- Challenge or comment on something the research surfaced
- Say they're good to move on

Only after the user is done reacting to the debrief, render the transition prompt (format defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/prompt-templates-runtime.md`):

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**▶ NEXT:** `/clear` then `/research:start-phase` — Start Phase [N+1] with a fresh context window.

**Also available:**
- `/research:progress` — See the overall project dashboard before clearing.
- `/research:check-gaps` — Confirm no unresolved gaps from Phase [N] should be carried forward.

**What to expect:** A fresh context window gives sharper analysis for the new phase. STATE.md and commonplace.md carry everything forward — no context is lost. Start-phase will read the research plan, gaps, commonplace entries, and open assumptions, and brief you on what Phase [N+1] needs.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **No bypassing.** If the user asks to skip the audit or move a failed draft to outputs manually, refuse. Explain that the audit gate exists to protect research quality and that fixing the issues is faster than dealing with unreliable findings downstream.
- **No soft passes.** Do not downgrade a high-severity issue to moderate to make the draft pass. If a claim doesn't trace to a source, it's unsupported regardless of whether the claim "feels right."
- **Recording a waiver is not re-auditing.** A valid `waive:` message is recorded the moment it arrives — draft Methodology & Limitations, audit report, gate-log — even when no audit is running, and even though the draft does not promote until the user re-invokes the audit. The "never auto-re-run" rule below governs the audit loop, not the record. Never let a waiver the user granted end the turn with no trace on disk.
- **Re-audit after fixes.** When a draft is fixed after a failed audit, run the full audit again — do not spot-check only the previously flagged issues. Fixes can introduce new problems. Re-audit is always user-invoked — the user runs `/research:audit-claims <same-filepath>` after fixing the draft, and each invocation is treated as a fresh audit (full check, no shortcuts). The agent does not automatically re-run audits in a loop.
- **No confidence tier inflation.** Do not inflate confidence tiers. If a section relies on a single source, it is Low confidence regardless of how authoritative that source is. Single-source High confidence does not exist — triangulation requires multiple independent sources.
- **Phase close is against the whole contract, never one file.** The deliverable manifest check (After Audit / If PASS step 2) is mandatory before any closeout. If the plan promises three synthesis outputs and one has been audited, the phase stays open — no debrief, no Active-phase advance, no "all phases complete." Record the partial progress in Next Action and stop.
- **A passing audit that completes the deliverable manifest must advance STATE.md before the debrief.** Promotion, phase closeout (check off Verify, mark Phase N complete, advance Active phase to N+1, generate the new cycle checklist, reset Next Action) all happen in one atomic step before you present findings to the user. The debrief is for the user; the STATE.md advance is for the next session. The next session may start with `/clear` immediately followed by `/research:discover` (skipping `/research:start-phase` entirely) — if STATE.md still points at Phase N when that happens, discover will either error or silently re-discover a completed phase. If you cannot advance STATE.md cleanly — e.g., `research/research-plan.md` is missing Phase N+1 and Phase N was not marked as final, or the cycle checklist has unchecked steps you did not expect — stop, surface the discrepancy to the user, and do NOT leave STATE.md half-updated. Either the full closeout happens or none of it does.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Soft passes — downgrading severity to make a draft pass | Every severity classification must cite the specific rule it violates. If a claim lacks a source, it is high-severity regardless of how plausible it sounds. |
| Scope narrowing — auditing only "important" claims while skipping minor ones | Audit every factual claim, including numbers in passing references and claims inherited from prior phases. Minor claims are where drift hides. |
| Treating audit as formality — skimming rather than tracing each claim to its source | For each claim, open the cited source note and verify the value. Do not rely on memory of what the source said. |
| Post-fix spot-checking — only re-checking flagged issues after a fix | Re-run the full audit after fixes. Edits can introduce new mismatches, especially when adjusting ranges or qualifiers. |
| Consistency blind spot — auditing the draft in isolation without checking other outputs | Always run the cross-document consistency check and canonical figures check. Same claim, different numbers across documents is high-severity. |
| Conflating confidence with audit pass/fail — treating low confidence as a failure | Confidence tier measures evidence strength (how well-supported). Audit pass/fail measures evidence accuracy (how truthfully represented). A section with one source, accurately cited, passes the audit with Low confidence — unless the project's own evidence standard names that pattern as unacceptable, in which case it fails as an audience-standard violation. The standard gate enforces the user's commissioned rules; the tier stays advisory for everything the standard doesn't name. |
| Waiving standards on the user's behalf — treating a shrug as a waiver | A waiver exists only when the user typed `waive: <claim> — <rationale>` with a real rationale in their own words. "Fine, ship it" is not a waiver — re-ask with the format. Never author the rationale yourself; it appears verbatim in the deliverable's Methodology & Limitations under the commissioner's name. |
| Accepting a waiver in conversation and recording it nowhere — deferring the write to a re-audit that may never come | The waiver arrives as a bare message after the failed audit; there is no audit running to carry the write. Record it on that turn, in all three loci (draft M&L verbatim, audit report Waivers section, gate-log `waived` row), then hand the re-run back to the user. Recording is not re-auditing — "never auto-re-run" restrains the loop, not the record. A granted waiver that leaves no on-disk trace reads, later, exactly like a waiver that was ignored. |
| Blanket-waiving on a scoped rationale — letting one waiver clear every open finding | The waiver covers the finding its rationale addresses. Two violations and a rationale that speaks to one leaves the other open and the draft unpromoted. Say which findings the waiver clears and which remain — do not stretch the user's words, and do not make them re-type a waiver you could scope yourself. |
| Override laundering — a commissioner override reaching the deliverable as if the evidence produced it | For every resolution the draft relies on, compare `user_resolution` to `suggested_resolution` in cross-reference.md — never trust the `user_override` boolean alone (a `confirm: side-A` against a side-B assessment may carry no flag). If the fields differ, verify the label survived into the draft (finding site + Methodology & Limitations). The internal record is not the disclosure — the reader of the output must see that the commissioner chose against the evidence assessment. |
| Treating Methodology & Limitations as the writer's problem | Summarize-section writes the section; this audit gates on it (step 5b). A draft whose claims all trace but whose section is missing, boilerplate, or stamped with an adverse search that has no record does not promote. The section is part of the deliverable's evidence contract, not decoration. |
| Closing a multi-deliverable phase on one audited file | The deliverable manifest check (If PASS step 2) reads the plan's promised output inventory and requires every deliverable to exist in `outputs/` with a passing audit before closeout. A synthesis phase promising executive summary + report + recommendations needs all three audited — auditing `00-executive-summary.md` alone leaves the phase open with Next Action pointing at the next deliverable. |
| Silent phase closeout — promoting the draft and presenting the debrief but leaving STATE.md pointing at the completed phase | On PASS, execute the full closeout sequence in `After Audit / If PASS` step 3 before presenting the debrief. Every write — check off Verify, mark Phase N complete, advance Active phase to N+1, reset Cycle step, replace Current Phase Cycle with a fresh Phase N+1 checklist, reset per-phase source counters, rewrite Next Action — must land in STATE.md atomically. If any part cannot be completed (e.g., research-plan.md has no Phase N+1), stop and surface the discrepancy instead of partially updating. The next session may skip `/research:start-phase` and run `/research:discover` directly — STATE.md must be correct before the debrief, not after. |
| Leaving the completed phase's cycle checklist in Current Phase Cycle alongside the new one | `Current Phase Cycle` always reflects exactly one active phase. When advancing to Phase N+1, replace the Phase N checklist entirely — the completed record lives in `Completed Phases`, not in `Current Phase Cycle`. Two checklists in `Current Phase Cycle` is a bug, not a history feature. |
| Listing issues without applying mechanical fixes — stopping after the report instead of editing the draft | On FAIL, the 4-step sequence is mandatory: classify → apply mechanical fixes → list changes → tell user to re-run. If a fix is mechanical (correct value knowable from sources), apply it with the Edit tool. Do not present fixes as suggestions — make the edits. |
| Graph write blocking audit promotion — treating a claim-graph.json write failure as an audit failure | Graph write is supplementary infrastructure, not an evidence gate. If claim-graph.json cannot be written or parsed, log a WARNING in the audit report but continue to the pass/fail determination. The audit gate protects research quality; the graph is for downstream traceability (Phase 12). Never fail an audit or block promotion due to a graph write issue. |
| Skipping drift detection when claim-graph.json exists — missing drift warnings because graph parse is slow or unexpected | Always attempt drift detection when claim-graph.json exists and parses. A drift_warning in the claim graph means a canonical figure changed after a claim was written — surfacing it is the point. Only skip if the file is absent or unparseable. |

## Output
Scorecard summary and pass/fail status.

**If failed:** Execute the full 4-step fail sequence (classify → apply mechanical fixes → list changes and remaining issues → tell user to re-run). Do NOT render a transition prompt — a failed audit is a loop, not a transition. Do NOT stop after listing issues — if any fix is mechanical, apply it before responding to the user.

**If a waiver arrives after the failed audit:** record it on that turn — draft Methodology & Limitations verbatim, audit report Waivers section, gate-log `waived` row — then hand the re-run back to the user (see "Waiver Arriving Between Audits"). Do not defer the write to an audit that has not been invoked.

**If passed:** confirm the promotion to `outputs/`, present the phase debrief (see above), wait for the user to react, and then render the transition prompt (format defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/prompt-templates-runtime.md`). The transition prompt appears only after the user is done reacting to the debrief — not before.
