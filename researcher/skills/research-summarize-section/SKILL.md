name: research-summarize-section
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to draft, synthesize, or write up a section from the sources collected so far (e.g. "draft the phase 2 section", "synthesize what we have on pricing", "write up the findings"). Pulls claims and evidence from relevant processed sources into a draft under research/drafts/ and stages it for the /research:audit-claims gate — never writes straight to outputs/.

# /research:summarize-section

Synthesize research notes into a draft output section for a specific phase or topic. Drafts are written to `research/drafts/` — NOT `research/outputs/`. Only `/research:audit-claims` can promote a draft to `outputs/`.

## Input
The user will provide a section name or phase number to summarize.

## Pre-checks (mandatory)

Before writing anything, verify:
1. **`research/cross-reference.md`** has been updated within the last 5-8 sources. If it hasn't, stop and run `/research:cross-ref` first.
2. **`research/gaps.md`** has been updated for this phase. If it hasn't, stop and run `/research:check-gaps` first.
3. **`research/cross-reference.md` has no unresolved core contradictions.** Read the Contradictions section. If any contradiction classified as "core" (directly addresses a current phase question) has status "unresolved," stop and tell the user:

   ```
   Synthesis blocked — unresolved contradictions on core phase questions:

   - [Contradiction description]: [Source A claim] vs. [Source B claim]
     Suggested resolution: [Claude's suggestion from cross-ref]

   To proceed, resolve each contradiction by running /research:cross-ref and confirming or overriding the suggested resolution. Peripheral contradictions (flagged but not core) do not block synthesis.
   ```

   Do not proceed until all core contradictions are resolved. Peripheral contradictions (those not directly addressing a current phase question) should be noted in the draft but do not block synthesis.

4. **Source staleness advisory.** Read `research/research-plan.md` to identify the research type, then read the corresponding type template in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/templates/types/` to get the **Staleness Threshold** value. Read all source notes in `research/notes/` relevant to this section. For each source note, compare its **data year** (not publication year — a 2025 article citing 2021 data uses 2021) against `current year minus threshold`. If any sources exceed the threshold, display a staleness advisory before proceeding:

   ```
   Source staleness advisory (threshold: N years for [research type]):

   - [source-note-filename]: data year [YYYY], [M] years over threshold
   - [source-note-filename]: data year [YYYY], [M] years over threshold

   These sources will be included in synthesis with age caveats. Stale evidence is still evidence but carries reduced weight.
   ```

   This is a **warning, not a gate** — synthesis proceeds after displaying the advisory. If no sources exceed the threshold, skip the advisory silently.

5. **Counter-evidence gate (PRD Validation and Exploratory Thesis only).** Read `research/research-plan.md` to determine the research type. If the type is PRD Validation or Exploratory Thesis:
   a. Scan all processed source notes in `research/notes/` for this phase.
   b. Look for findings tagged CHALLENGED (PRD Validation) or CONTRADICTED (Exploratory Thesis) from sources with credibility tier above "blog/opinion" level (official docs, analyst reports, peer-reviewed, industry data, developer community).
   c. If at least one credible source has a CHALLENGED or CONTRADICTED finding, the gate passes — proceed.
   d. If no credible counter-evidence exists, check for a **documented adverse search** — the gate's second legitimate exit. Read `research/reference/retrieval-log.json` and the phase's candidates file(s) in `research/discovery/` and identify queries that specifically sought opposing evidence (negating/challenging terms, counter-viewpoint channels). If such a search was run and surfaced nothing credible, present the record for acknowledgment:

   ```
   No credible counter-evidence exists in the processed sources — but an adverse search was run and came back empty:

   - Queries: [the challenging-term queries, verbatim, with dates]
   - Channels: [channels searched]
   - What came back: [N results reviewed; why none qualified as credible counter-evidence]

   "Named, searched, none found" is a legitimate recorded outcome. If you acknowledge this record, synthesis proceeds and the output is stamped: "No credible counter-evidence found after documented search ([N] queries across [channels], [date]) — acknowledged by commissioner."

   Acknowledge, or direct further search?
   ```

   On acknowledgment: append the record (phase, date, queries, channels, results reviewed, outcome, acknowledgment) to `research/discovery/negative-searches.md` (create with a one-line header if absent), then proceed to synthesis and include the stamp in the draft's Methodology & Limitations section.

   e. If no credible counter-evidence exists AND no adverse search has been run, block synthesis:

   ```
   Synthesis blocked — no counter-evidence found for [research type], and no adverse search is on record.

   [Research type] requires either a credible challenging source or a documented adverse search before synthesis can proceed. This ensures the research stress-tests its thesis rather than just confirming it.

   Current sources all [support/validate] the position. To proceed:
   1. Run /research:discover with terms like "[negating/challenging terms for the thesis]"
   2. Look for sources from [suggest specific channels: academic databases, industry analysts, competing viewpoints]
   3. Process any source that presents counter-evidence — or, if the search genuinely comes back empty, tell me: I'll record the negative search in research/discovery/negative-searches.md, you acknowledge it, and synthesis proceeds with the output stamped "no credible counter-evidence found after documented search."
   ```

   This gate applies to every phase in PRD Validation and Exploratory Thesis types, not just the final synthesis. The valve (exit d) is not a bypass: it requires an actual adverse search recorded with queries and channels, plus explicit user acknowledgment. "We probably won't find anything" satisfies nothing.

6. **Pre-check 6 — Lopsided coverage advisory.** Read `research/gaps.md` and find the questions relevant to this section. If any question has a lopsided coverage flag (only 1 independent Direct source), display an advisory:

   ```
   Lopsided coverage advisory:

   - Q: [question text] — 1 independent source ([source-note-filename])
   - Q: [question text] — 1 independent source ([source-note-filename])

   These questions are supported by a single independent data point. Findings from these questions will be flagged with "single source suggests" language per guardrail 5. Consider running /research:discover to find additional independent sources before synthesis.
   ```

   This is a **warning, not a gate** — synthesis proceeds after displaying the advisory. If no questions have lopsided coverage, skip the advisory silently.

If any pre-check fails, do not proceed. Tell the user which check failed and what to run. Note: pre-checks 4 and 6 are advisories that do not block synthesis — they display warnings and then allow synthesis to proceed.

## Process

1. **Read `research/research-plan.md`** to understand what this phase/section covers and what questions it needs to answer.
2. **Read `research/reference/writing-standards.md`** for output formatting rules.
3. **Read `research/reference/source-standards.md`** for citation and evidence rules.
4. **Read all relevant files in `research/notes/`** that pertain to this section.
5. **Read `research/cross-reference.md`** for patterns relevant to this section. Include resolved contradiction decisions in the draft — present the resolution with the reasoning, not just the winning side. The reader should see that a disagreement existed and how it was resolved. Note any peripheral unresolved contradictions in the draft as open questions that do not affect the section's core findings.

   **Commissioner overrides are disclosed where they land.** When a resolution carries `user_override=true` (the commissioner resolved a contradiction against or beyond the evidence assessment), the draft must say so at the finding site, not just internally: state what the evidence assessment was, then the commissioner's resolution, explicitly labeled — e.g., "Cross-referencing assessed Source B as stronger (disclosed methodology, recency); the commissioner directed resolution toward Source A **[commissioner override]**. Confidence in this finding is reduced accordingly." Never present an overridden resolution as if the evidence produced it, and list every override again in the Methodology & Limitations section.
6. **Read `research/gaps.md`** — if there are unresolved gaps for this phase, note them explicitly in the draft as open questions.
7. **Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/evidence-failure-modes.md`** to understand the evidence degradation patterns to avoid during synthesis.
8. **Write a draft section** to `research/drafts/<part-number>-<section-slug>.md`.

   **Before writing, check if the target file already exists at that path.** If it does, a prior draft is already in flight — do not silently overwrite it. Present the user with three named options: **(a) overwrite** — the existing draft is replaced entirely; note that any matching audit report in `research/audits/` for the old draft becomes stale and should be deleted or renamed by the user before the new draft is audited; **(b) suffix** — write the new draft to `research/drafts/<part-number>-<section-slug>-v2.md` instead and leave the original in place; **(c) cancel** — stop the synthesis entirely; do not write anything. Wait for the user to pick one. Do not proceed on an ambiguous response — re-ask. Only after the user chooses, write the draft with these requirements:

   - Lead with findings, support with evidence
   - Every finding answers "so what does this mean?"
   - Apply the project's finding tags to key conclusions. Tag set fallback chain: **(1)** read `CLAUDE.md` and use the Finding Tags section; **(2)** if missing, fall back to the type template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/templates/types/{research-type}.md`; **(3)** if neither source has a tag set, do not invent tags — render findings without tags and add an explicit note in the draft's opening metadata: "Finding tags unavailable for this project — CLAUDE.md and type template both missing the Finding Tags section. Tagging skipped." Do not block synthesis on missing tags.
   - Cite sources inline using `[Source: <note-filename>]`
   - Use prose paragraphs, not bullet lists (except for data tables and key findings)
   - Present contradictions when sources disagree
   - No orphan claims — if it can't be cited, flag it as inference
   - **End every draft with a `## Methodology & Limitations` section.** This section is part of the deliverable, not backstage — it is what keeps the output honest to a reader who wasn't in the engagement. It contains:
     1. **Sampling disclosure:** "Sources were gathered by purposive sampling through mapped discovery channels, not exhaustive literature coverage. Where this report notes that evidence was not found, that means 'not found via the mapped channels,' not 'does not exist.'" (Adapt the wording to the project; keep the substance.)
     2. **Single-source findings:** list each finding resting on one independent source (or "none").
     3. **Commissioner overrides:** each `user_override=true` resolution, labeled, with the evidence assessment it overrode (or "none").
     4. **Counter-evidence status** (types with the counter-evidence gate): either the credible challenger(s) cited, or the adverse-search stamp from pre-check 5's documented-adverse-search exit.
     5. **Waivers:** left as a placeholder line — `/research:audit-claims` inserts any commissioner waivers verbatim at audit time.
8a. **Log assumptions to `research/assumptions.md`.** While writing the draft, identify any judgment or finding that meets these criteria:
    - Based on a single source (already flagged with "single source suggests" per guardrail 5)
    - Inferred from indirect evidence rather than directly stated
    - Extrapolated beyond what the source data strictly supports
    - Based on sources that exceed the staleness threshold

    For each assumption identified, append an entry to `research/assumptions.md` (create the file if it does not exist). Entry format:

    ```markdown
    ### [Short assumption description]
    - **Status:** Open
    - **Phase:** [phase number and name]
    - **Section:** [draft section name]
    - **Basis:** [What evidence exists and why it is thin — e.g., "single source (vendor whitepaper)", "inferred from adjacent market data", "based on 2021 data exceeding 2-year threshold"]
    - **What would validate:** [What kind of evidence would confirm this]
    - **What would challenge:** [What kind of evidence would overturn this]
    - **Added:** [date]
    ```

    The file header (create only if file does not exist):
    ```markdown
    # Research Assumptions Record

    Judgments synthesized from weak, thin, or indirect evidence. Revisit when new phases add evidence.

    **Statuses:** Open (still assumed) | Validated (later evidence confirmed) | Challenged (later evidence contradicts)

    ---
    ```

    When adding new assumptions, also scan existing assumptions in the file. If new evidence from current synthesis validates or challenges a prior assumption, update its status from Open to Validated or Challenged and add a note with the evidence that changed it.

9. **Run the research-integrity agent** on the draft. Pass the filepath. If the agent finds issues, fix them in the draft before proceeding. Do not move to audit with known integrity issues — fix them now while the source context is fresh.

   **Verify the agent returned a real result.** A real result is either (a) an explicit "no integrity issues found" confirmation for the filepath you passed, or (b) a list of issues with specific file locations (line numbers, claim text, or section names). An empty response, a tool-error return, or a generic acknowledgment with no issue list does NOT count as "integrity checked" — if that happens, do not report the draft as integrity-checked, surface the agent failure to the user, and either re-invoke the agent or fall back to a manual re-read of the draft against the source notes. Do not proceed to Step 10 (STATE.md update) until a real integrity result is recorded.
10. **Update `research/STATE.md`** — note the draft was written, integrity-checked, and is pending audit.

## Guardrails

1. Write only from source notes in `research/notes/`. If a fact is not in a source note, it does not go in the draft.
2. Preserve every qualifier from the source. "Primarily in enterprise deployments" does not become "broadly adopted."
3. When sources disagree, present the disagreement. Do not smooth contradictions into a consensus that does not exist.
4. Preserve the full range from source notes. If the source says "$2M–$8M," the draft says "$2M–$8M," not "$4M–$8M" or "approximately $5M."
5. Flag any finding supported by only one source with "single source suggests" language. Do not present single-source findings as established facts.
6. Run the research-integrity agent before declaring the draft ready for audit. Do not skip this step.
7. Never synthesize past an unresolved core contradiction. If cross-reference.md shows unresolved contradictions on questions this section addresses, the pre-check should have caught it. If you reach synthesis and notice a contradiction that was not in cross-reference.md, stop and flag it — do not smooth it into consensus.
8. When a source exceeds the staleness threshold, include its findings in the draft but add an explicit age caveat noting the data year. Do not silently present stale data as current.
9. Every "single source suggests" finding in the draft must have a corresponding entry in `research/assumptions.md`. If you wrote "single source suggests" but did not log the assumption, go back and add it.
10. Do not bypass the counter-evidence gate by re-tagging a supporting source as CHALLENGED. The gate requires genuinely opposing evidence from a credible source, not relabeled confirmatory evidence. The documented-adverse-search exit is equally protected: it requires a real search record (queries, channels, dates) and explicit user acknowledgment — do not fabricate or embellish a search record to unlock synthesis.
11. **Real people are protected by default.** For research types that observe or profile real individuals (Person Research, Customer Safari), the draft anonymizes everyone other than the commissioned research subject unless a source note records explicit permission: no usernames, handles, or real names of community members or third parties; attribute quotes as "a community member on [platform]" or equivalent. Real specificity, not real identity — keep the exact words, the platform, and the context; drop the identity. The fail direction is always over-anonymization. (Notes may hold identifying source links for traceability; the *deliverable* does not expose them.)

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Synthesizing from memory instead of source notes | For every claim in the draft, find the corresponding source note and verify the value. If you wrote the source notes earlier in the session, re-read them anyway — memory drifts. |
| Dropping qualifiers during compression | Compare the draft's language against each cited source note. If a qualifier was present in the note, it must be present in the draft or the simplification must be noted explicitly. |
| Smoothing contradictions into false consensus | When two sources disagree, present both positions with citations. "Source A reports X; Source B reports Y" is correct. "Evidence suggests approximately Z" (splitting the difference) is fabrication. |
| Range narrowing — presenting the favorable end of a range | Every range in the draft must match the source note's range exactly. Check endpoints. If the source says "5–25%" and the draft says "15–25%," the lower bound was dropped. |
| False precision — converting ranges to point estimates | "The market is $4.7B" when the source says "$3–6B" is false precision. Preserve the range. |
| Synthesizing past unresolved contradictions — smoothing disagreements into false consensus | Check cross-reference.md Contradictions section before writing. If any core contradiction is unresolved, stop. Do not proceed by picking the "more likely" side — the user must explicitly decide. |
| Treating stale sources as equally current — using old data without age caveat | Check each source's data year against the type's staleness threshold. If stale, include the finding but add an age caveat: "Based on [YYYY] data..." so the reader knows the evidence may not reflect current conditions. |
| Silent assumptions — presenting thin-evidence judgments as established findings without logging them | Before finalizing the draft, re-read it and check every finding: is it supported by 2+ independent credible sources with direct evidence? If not, it is an assumption and must be logged to `research/assumptions.md`. |
| Counter-evidence theater — processing a weak source just to satisfy the gate | The counter-evidence gate requires a credible source (not blog/opinion tier) with a genuine CHALLENGED or CONTRADICTED finding. Processing a low-quality source and tagging it as challenging does not satisfy the gate — the source must genuinely present opposing evidence. When opposition genuinely does not exist, the honest path is the documented-adverse-search exit (pre-check 5d), not a manufactured challenger. |
| Manufacturing a challenger because the gate has no other visible exit | The gate has two exits: a credible challenging source, or a documented adverse search acknowledged by the user. If genuine search finds nothing, use the valve — record the negative search, get the acknowledgment, stamp the output. Never relabel a supporting source or process a straw-man source to escape the block. |
| Presenting an overridden resolution as evidence-driven | Check every carried-forward resolution for `user_override=true`. If present, the finding site must show the evidence assessment AND the labeled commissioner override, and the override must appear in Methodology & Limitations. The internal cross-reference record is not the disclosure. |
| Skipping the Methodology & Limitations section, or writing it as boilerplate | Every draft ends with the section, populated for THIS draft: real single-source findings listed, real overrides labeled, the actual counter-evidence status. A generic paragraph pasted across drafts defeats its purpose — the audit checks the content, not the heading. |
| Synthesizing lopsided questions with confident language | Check gaps.md for lopsided flags on this section's questions. If a question has only 1 independent source, use "single source suggests" language — not "evidence shows" or "research confirms." |

## Output

Confirm the draft was written to `research/drafts/`, integrity-checked, and summarize the key findings. Then render the transition prompt (format defined in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/prompt-templates-runtime.md`):

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**▶ NEXT:** `/research:audit-claims research/drafts/<filename>` — Fact-check the draft against source notes before it moves to `outputs/`.

**What to expect:** Audit-claims traces every factual claim to its source note, checks for range narrowing and qualifier stripping, and either promotes the draft to `outputs/` or lists specific issues to fix. This is a hard gate — nothing reaches `outputs/` without passing.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The "Also available" section is omitted here because audit-claims is the only legitimate next step after a draft is written — summarize-section → audit-claims is a required pipeline, not a choice.
