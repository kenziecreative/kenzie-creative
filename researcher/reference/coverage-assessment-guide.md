# Coverage Assessment Guide

How to distinguish real coverage from thin coverage when assessing research gaps.

## Evidence Depth vs. Breadth

- **Breadth:** How many of the phase's questions have at least one source?
- **Depth:** For each addressed question, how many independent sources provide substantive evidence?

A phase can have high breadth and low depth — every question touched but none answered well enough to write a defensible synthesis. Report both dimensions.

## What "Addressed" Actually Means

A question is **addressed** when:
- A source note contains a specific claim, data point, or argument that directly answers the question
- The evidence is substantive — enough to write about, not just a passing mention
- The source note is in `research/notes/`, not in conversation memory

A question is **NOT addressed** when:
- A source mentions the topic but provides no evidence (e.g., "market size is important" without a number)
- The answer exists only in conversation memory, not in a processed source note
- A source addresses a related but different question — classify as Adjacent, not Direct (see Match Classification)
- The only "evidence" is the source repeating a claim without its own data

## Match Classification

Every source note's relevance to a given question is classified into one of four tiers:

- **Direct:** Source contains a specific claim, data point, or argument that substantively answers the question. The source's evidence directly addresses the question's subject matter. Direct matches count toward coverage status.
- **Adjacent:** Source addresses a related topic but does not answer the specific question. Example: a source about "cloud infrastructure market size" is adjacent to a question about "AWS market share" — related but not the same question. Display with explanation: "Addresses [actual topic] rather than [phase question]". Adjacent matches do **not** count toward coverage status.
- **Contradicts:** Source actively opposes or contradicts the research question's hypothesis — same topic as the question but arguing the opposite conclusion. Distinguished from Adjacent (which is a different topic) and from Direct (which supports the question). Display with explanation: "Contradicts [phase question] by [brief description]". Contradicts matches do **not** count toward Direct coverage status, but do trigger "Evidence Against" status when no Direct sources exist.
- **None:** Source does not address the question or any related topic. Not listed in per-question detail.

**Critical rule:** Adjacent matches do not contribute to coverage status. A question with 3 Adjacent sources and 0 Direct sources is **Not Started**, not Partial or Complete.

**Critical rule:** Contradicts is not Adjacent. A source arguing against the hypothesis is Contradicts. A source about a related-but-different topic is Adjacent. Never use Adjacent as a catch-all for inconvenient sources — the distinction is load-bearing for Evidence Against detection.

## Source Diversity Requirements

Questions answered by only one source type carry coverage risk:

| Source Composition | Risk Level | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 3+ independent sources, mixed types | Low | Solid coverage |
| 2-3 sources, same type (e.g., all vendor blogs) | Moderate | Flag as "covered but source-type skewed" |
| 1 source only | High | Flag as "thin — single source" |
| Multiple sources, all citing the same original | High | Flag as "echo — one underlying data point" |

**Balance risk:** Questions answered by sources from only one perspective (e.g., all pro, all con, all from incumbents) have balance risk even if source count is adequate.

## Coverage Status Definitions

Use these labels consistently in `research/gaps.md`. All statuses are calculated using **independent Direct source count only** — Adjacent matches do not contribute.

- **Complete:** 3+ **independent** sources with **Direct** matches, no unresolved contradictions, source types are mixed
- **Partial:** 1-2 **independent** sources with Direct matches, or sources exist but coverage is thin, one-sided, or source-type skewed
- **Not started:** No source notes have a **Direct** match for this question (including questions with only Adjacent matches)
- **Evidence Against:** No source notes have a **Direct** match for this question, but at least one source note is classified **Contradicts** — meaning active counter-evidence exists. Distinguished from "Not started" (which means no sources at all, for or against). An Evidence Against question is a synthesis challenge: the user must address the contradiction, not find more sources. Discovery will not resolve it.
- **Addressed but unbalanced:** **Direct** sources exist but represent only one perspective or source type

**Note:** Adjacent matches do not contribute to coverage status. A question with 3 Adjacent sources and 0 Direct sources is Not Started.

## Source Independence

Independence determines how many distinct data points exist for a question — not how many source notes reference it.

- Independence is established by the **origin_chain field** in source notes only when it affirmatively identifies distinct origins
- **Independence defaults to unknown, never assumed.** A source whose origin chain reads "Origin unclear" has UNKNOWN independence: it counts toward Direct coverage existence but supplies no corroboration credit. A question whose 2+-source status rests on unclear-origin sources is "independence unverified" — treat as lopsided-risk, not confirmed convergence. Three differently-worded articles from one hidden press release are one data point, whether or not any of them says so.
- Sources sharing the same cited original (e.g., multiple articles all citing the same Gartner report) collapse to **one independent data point**
- **Shared-wording / shared-figure heuristics:** near-identical phrasing, the same uncommon figure with identical rounding, or the same unattributed quote across sources — especially unclear-origin ones — mark a *suspected* shared-origin cluster. Treat it as Echo level (one data point) until independence is established.
- Coverage status uses independent source count: 3 sources sharing one origin = 1 independent = Partial, not Complete
- Two sources with clear, distinct origins that independently reach the same conclusion are still two independent sources — collapse requires tracing to the same origin (confirmed or suspected), not mere agreement
- Cross-reference with `pattern-recognition-guide.md` Echo level for shared-origin clusters

## When to Accept Gaps

A gap is **acceptable** when:
- Sources for the question were **not found via the mapped discovery channels** after actual searching (not just assumption). Note the limit of the claim: purposive sampling through mapped channels can establish "not found where we looked," never "does not exist." Record the gap in those terms.
- The user has explicitly acknowledged the gap and decided to proceed
- The question is peripheral to the phase's core objective

A gap is **NOT acceptable** just because:
- It is documented in gaps.md (documenting a gap does not resolve it)
- The phase has "enough" sources overall (coverage is per-question, not per-phase)
- Finding sources would take too long (flag the time constraint to the user, let them decide)

## Coverage Assessment Workflow

For each phase question:
1. List source notes that address the question — classify each as Direct, Adjacent, Contradicts, or None
2. For Contradicts classifications: verify the source actively argues against the hypothesis (not merely presenting a different facet). If in doubt, use Adjacent — only use Contradicts when the source's conclusion directly opposes the research question.
3. For Direct sources, verify the evidence is substantive (not a passing mention)
4. Check source independence using origin_chain — collapse shared-origin sources to one independent data point
5. Check source type diversity
6. Check perspective balance
7. Assign a coverage status using the definitions above — based on independent Direct source count only
